This paper aims to investigate the joint beamforming strategy in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided high-mobility communications with channel aging effect. Specifically, a novel frame structure is first proposed for alleviating the heavy signaling overhead in the RIS-aided high-mobility scenario. Furthermore, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm is devised for rapidly co-designing the precoder at the base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the RIS relying exclusively upon partial channel state information (CSI) and real-time environment feedback, instead of only employing the outdated estimated CSI. The proposed joint beamforming scheme is capable of adapting to the dynamic propagation environment by exploiting the channel correlation between consecutive instants. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively mitigate the performance degradation caused by channel aging while being computationally efficient and outperforms several benchmark schemes."}, "conf/apnoms/LiWLC21": {"title": "Business Demand-Oriented Intelligent Orchestration of Network Slices Based on Core-Edge Collaboration.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562680", "year": "2021", "author": {"Naling Li": "271/5741", "Ying Wang 0002": "94/3104-2", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Ke Chen": "47/6529"}, "abstract": " Abstract:5G enables many industries, and each industry's application requirements vary greatly. Today's “one-size-fits-all” network architecture approach no longer meets the needs at the same time. The introduction of network slicing brings great flexibility to the network, so that the network can be customized, deployed and dynamically guaranteed. However, how to orchestrate the functions of network slices according to the needs of business scenarios is an important challenge for slice operation. In order to solve the problem that the existing methods can hardly distinguish the differential requirements of different slices for delay, bandwidth and node load balancing, this paper proposes an exclusive orchestration optimization goal to match the business requirements, and establishes a business demand-oriented network slice orchestration problem model. Then, aiming at the typical slices, a business-oriented slicing algorithm based on DQN (BOSAD) is proposed. In this algorithm, we propose the strategy of cooperating the core data center and the edge data center, which can effectively save bandwidth and reduce network delay. The experimental results show that the proposed BOSAD saves the consumption of bandwidth resources, reduces the average slice delay and optimizes node load balancing."}, "conf/apnoms/ChenWYL21": {"title": "Security-Oriented Network Slice Backup Method.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.23919/APNOMS52696.2021.9562592", "year": "2021", "author": {"Ke Chen": "47/6529", "Ying Wang 0002": "94/3104-2", "Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Naling Li": "271/5741"}, "abstract": " Abstract:5G realizes flexible networking by building network slices, and its realization depends on network function virtualization (NFV) technology, which combines different types of virtual network functions (VNFs) to provide network services.

The emergence of Software Defined Network (SDN) provides a more flexible and effective way to control traffic in the network. Existing TE solutions mainly focus on routing traffic via the shortest path or evenly distributing the traffic among multiple available paths, but these methods are not flexible since this static mapping of traffic to paths does not consider either the current network utilization or traffic load. Heuristics-based TE methods depends on operators' understanding of the workload and environment. Designing and implementing those methods thus take at least weeks. Furthermore, it usually takes minutes to output the solution. Inspired by recent successes in applying Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques to solve complex control problems, we leverage DRL to control traffic in SDN.

In CNs, cross-layer design that relies on the interaction and cooperation of nonadjacent layers is a potential way to alleviate and cope with the unique issues created by traditional layered architecture. Nevertheless, the existing cross-layer designs server to highlight specific shortcomings of the layered architecture and are always protocol stack centric, paying little attention to the unified platform of various cross-layer schemes.

Then, the formulated resource allocation problem is discussed in the single- and multi-VUE case, respectively. To be specific, for the single-VUE case, a closed-form expression of the average rate is derived by extracting the statistical characteristics of mmWave channels, and an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm is proposed. For the multi-VUE case, we develop an efficient algorithm, called JAPMC, to circumvent the unavailability of the closed-form of the objective function and probabilistic constraint by constructing quadratic surrogates of that.

The cross-tier interference, treated as evil by traditional wisdom, is employed to confuse the malicious node as well as to tackle the conflict between the secrecy and traditional performances through the prudent spectrum allocation among the small cells. Three games are designed to progressively give insight into the frequency assignment problems under increasingly strict scenes. With the help of game theoretic stochastic learning approaches and location information, small cell base stations (SBSs) are endowed with the ability to distributedly select the subchannel with no requirement on the eavesdropper's CSI. First, more specifically, we focus on the security problem, aiming to promote the safety transmission of macro users by leveraging a state field, and thus formulate the spectrum selection of SBSs as a state-based potential game, which guarantees a budget-balanced utility design. The existence of a recurrent state equilibrium point is proved, and that it is able to maximize the total safety transmission probability of all subchannels. A step forward, we take the service delay of SBSs into consideration, nowadays, as numerous new services are delay-sensitive. To this end, an exact potential game, in which the equilibrium always exists, is built to help SBSs strike a balance between altruistically helping the macro users and selfishly keeping their own performances. Furthermore, a fully distributed non-cooperative game that requires no exchange among SBSs is put forward. The proposed scheme may work well even when the backhaul is limited or even unavailable since all the SBSs only depend on the observation of their own instantaneous performances.

Nowadays the network scale and the magnitude of flows increase greatly, which leads to the need to deploy a large number of flow entries in face of failures.

This leads to additional cache leasing cost brought by the lease of storage from mobile users. Besides, newly-emerging video-related applications also pose strict requirement on the network delay. Thus, it is of great significance to design caching strategies considering the transmission cost, the cache leasing cost and the delay. As the movement of mobile users can improve the communication opportunities among different users and increase the cache hit ratio, in this paper, mobility-aware caching strategies are designed to minimize the network cost including both the transmission cost and the cache leasing cost with the delay constraint. In specific, by characterizing the user mobility as an inter-contact model, analytical expressions of the average network cost and the average file delivery delay are derived and a cost-oriented mobility-aware caching problem is formulated. To handle this mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we first relax the binary cache placement indicator as a continuous one and prove that both the average network cost and the average file delivery delay are convex. Hence, an iterative caching algorithm is proposed with the successive convex approximation method. Moreover, to lower the complexity, combinatorial optimization method is adopted. Firstly, to make the caching problem tractable, the average file delivery delay constraint is implicitly added in the cost objective function as a penalty term. Then, the reformulated objective function is proved to have the non-monotone submodular property and thus a modified low-complexity greedy caching strategy is proposed.

This paper studies economically optimal MS association to tradeoff the cache-hit ratio and the ratio of MSs with satisfied quality of service (QoS). When the associated enhanced remote radio unit (eRRU) stores the requesting content, the content can be fetched directly from the local cache. Otherwise, fronthaul has to be used to fetch the content. The use of fronthaul resource and cache is treated as costs, and payments of QoS-satisfied MSs are treated as incomes. Thus, the economic MS association is formulated as an optimization problem to maximize the system utility, i.e., total profit of the network operator, which is defined as the difference between incomes and costs. A belief propagation-based method is employed to solve the problem on a developed factor graph. Simulation results show that the proposed economically optimal MS association achieves much higher profit than the existing schemes and works well in the network with various loads. Moreover, the profit of the proposed scheme can be improved with inter-cell interference coordination.

In this paper, to achieve the trade-off between grid power consumption and user’s QoS for each tier, optimal joint of ON/OFF mode of a BS and power source switching strategies are designed for two-tier femtocell networks, which are powered by the cooperation of the harvested energy and grid power. Then, exploiting stochastic geometry and random walk theory, BS availability and availability region are characterized with the proposed strategies. Moreover, the relationships among BS availability, battery capacity of grid power and cut-off energy level are exploited to verify the proposed strategies. By numerical simulations, we find that when energy storage capacity achieves a certain value, the effect of grid power battery capacity on availability almost vanishes especially in femto tier.

In IEEE 802.21 standard, a Media Independent Handover (MIH) framework is proposed to improve user experience of mobile devices by facilitating handover in heterogeneous networks with measurements and triggers from link layers. However, vertical handover decision making can benefit from the information more than link layers. In this paper, an Enhanced Media Independent Handover (EMIH) framework is proposed by integrating more information from application layers, user context and network context. Given such information, there is also another important problem on how to select a favorite network. Two quite important problems from realistic scenario are as follows: (1) how to make use of partial knowledge due to incomplete value measurement on decision factors; (2) how to deal with robustness problem due to inaccurate measurement on decision factors. In order to tackle these problems, two novel Weighted Markov Chain (WMC) approaches based on rank aggregation are proposed in this paper, in which a favorite network is selected as the top one of rank aggregation result fused from multiple ranking lists based on decision factors. Moreover, an entropy weighting method, combined with WMC approach, is studied.
