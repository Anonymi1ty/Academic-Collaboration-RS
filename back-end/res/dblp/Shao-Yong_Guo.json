MEC enhanced fiber-wireless heterogeneous network (FiWi HetNets) is considered to be a cost-effective scheme to improve the network coverage of IoT. However, due to the communication uncertainty caused by the change of channel conditions and the limited resources of the edge server, the offloaded task is at risk of failure caused by packet loss or overload of the edge server. Therefore, this paper proposes a risk-aware computing offload and resource allocation method to ensure the QoS of multimedia services. Firstly, we design a risk perception model based on conditional value at risk (CVaR) to measure the risk of 5G and WiFi wireless transmission modes, and formulate the optimization problem. Then, an A3C based optimization method for wireless access, computation offloading and resource allocation is proposed, to balance the end-to-end service delay.

The infrastructure providers (InP) can divide the physical network into multiple logical networks by NS, and the service provider (SP) can rent these NS instances from the InP to meet their own requirements. Since most multimedia services are usually QoS-aware, such as virtual reality (VR), mobile high-definition video and so on, caching resource can be allocated to different NS instances on demand to reduce the transmission delay and improving the quality of experience (QoE) of end-users. Due to the limited amount of caching resource, the issue about how to efficiently allocate caching resource to increase network revenues and save expenses becomes very critical for InPs.

As the network becomes larger, the control plane with one controller can no longer manage the network efficiently. Therefore, multiple controllers are needed to manage the network. However, the survivability has been a key challenge in multi-controller SDN, which is sensitive to the controller failures. Once the controller breaks down, the switches will lose connections to the controller. This leads to severe consequences. In this regard, we propose an approach to improve fault tolerance of network in face of controller failures. In our work, we also attach great importance to the survivability of connections between controller and switch under random-link failures. Propagation delay is considered in our approach. Simulation results show that our approach guarantees that the controller failures can be effectively recovered. Moreover, after the controller failure is recovered, the survivability of multi-controller SDN in face of random-link failures can be improved."}, "conf/noms/ZhongWQG18": {"title": "Cost-aware service function chain orchestration across multiple data centers.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/NOMS.2018.8406174", "year": "2018", "author": {"Xuxia Zhong": "186/7532", "Ying Wang 0002": "94/3104-2", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342", "Shaoyong Guo": "150/6843"}, "abstract": " Abstract:Network function virtualization is a new network architecture, where the dedicated hardware network functions can be implemented in network function instances running on general purpose hardware such as high volume servers in data centers.

Multiple NFs in a SFC are often orchestrated across multiple DCs to satisfy their position or performance requirements. However, different orchestration strategies of the SFC will lead to different deployment cost, including VNF instance cost and inter-DC bandwidth cost. Besides, large number of NFV instances are deployed in micro-DCs which have limited physical resource. Therefore, in this paper we investigate a costaware strategy to orchestrate the SFCs across multiple DCs, while considering the loads of DCs.

Cell Outage Detection (COD) which is the essential functionality in Self-Organizing Network (SON) is designed to autonomously deal with unexpected faults. Typical methods for detecting cell outage are usually based on Manual Drive Tests (MDT). However, it is difficult to detect small cell outage by MDT measurements in HetNets, because the User Equipment (UE) served by these small cells can switch to the macro cell and keep the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) values normal. To resolve this issue, we propose a COD architecture based on the handover statistics. Our model concentrates on cell outage detection in a two-tier heterogeneous network. We process sequential handover statistics spatially and temporally in conjunction with data mining methods. Also, an improved LOF algorithm (M-LOF) is proposed to enhance the detection performance based on handover statistics.

As regards to a security problem, attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been applied to the IoT system, but it still relies on the central server. Therefore, we design an ABE algorithm that could be used for multicenter scenario and shift DM to blockchain instead of a central server. Moreover, IoT devices always cannot afford complex encrypt computations as they have limited computing resource. To solve this, we design an obfuscating policy to shift encryption computations to the cloud instead of terminals. In this way, IoT devices could encrypt data with low computation cost.

However, with the explosive growth of business terminals, the capacity of single edge node is limited and it is difficult to meet all business requirements at the same time. Therefore, this article proposes a task allocation mechanism based on cooperative edge computing. Firstly, a task allocation model based on cooperation of two edge nodes is established to minimize the average task completion delay while meeting business requirements.

It could significantly affect the supply-demand relationship between electricity service providers (ESPs) and users, reduce energy cost and consumption, and contribute to sustainable development. To improve latency and processing performance, a three-tier edge-cloud collaborative REM (ECCREM) architecture is presented. In consideration of matching the architecture, a two-stage energy management mechanism is proposed with system reliability and resource utilization requirements taken into account. At the first stage, the interaction between real-time pricing and energy demand is modeled by a Stackelberg and Lyapunov-based pricing and energy demand joint optimization (SLPEDO) algorithm. At the second stage, two procedures, i.e., energy scheduling between a cloud tier and an access tier, and energy scheduling between an access tier and an infrastructure tier, are implemented. A priority-based demand ratio sequentially scheduling strategy is proposed to address energy scheduling in these two procedures, respectively. Simulation results show that compared with the existing demand ratio-based scheduling and equally scheduling strategies, the proposed strategy can improve overall satisfaction of users by up to 20%.

To solve it, the free resources displayed on non-mining-devices and edge cloud are selected to construct collaborative mining network(CMN) to execute mining tasks for mobile blockchain. Miners can offload their mining tasks to non-mining-devices within a CMN or the edge cloud when there are insufficient resources. Considering competition for resource of non-mining-devices, resource allocation problem in a CMN is formulated as a double auction game, among which Bayes-Nash Equilibrium (BNE) is analyzed to figure out the optimal auction price.
