One promising way to deal with this issue is to utilize mobile terminal resources by offloading the caching, transmission, or computing tasks to other available terminals nearby. Recent technology developments, such as device-to-device (D2D) direction communication, computing dense chips, are making terminals more powerful to enable the solution.

Motivated by these factors, we propose to decompose a network application into small subtasks to enable cooperation among multiple nodes, so that terminals can take part in complex tasks. Thus, resources in network terminals can be fully utilized, relieving the load pressure at the network edge.

In the architecture of mobile media cloud network, the wireless access points are placed on edge of the cloud to provide media services for the mobile users. The video bandwidth allocation managed by a centralized media cloud directly affect the user’s experiences. In this paper, the problem of the video bandwidth allocation in the mobile media cloud access network is explored. Firstly, this paper formulates the problems in bandwidth allocation in the form of quadratic programming in order to maximize the system revenue on the basis of video bitrates capacity between the user and the Mobile Access Edge Point (MAEP). The optimization model could more vividly explicate the trade-off between the expected bitrates capacity and the allocation fairness of User Equipment (UE).

The optimality of the solution is proved by both theoretical and experimental investigations. The error tolerance is analyzed as the algorithm disavows the trade-off between the convergence time and the system performance. The experiments show that the average computing time and confidence interval of the proposed algorithm are lower than Simplex algorithm by 68% and 94% and Barrier algorithm by 46% and 75% respectively at most. Finally, some conclusions are derived from evaluations on the system performance against various network topologies and different values for parameters of the proposed algorithms."}, "journals/wc/YuLZFYGGQ18": {"title": "Capacity Enhancement for 5G Networks Using MmWave Aerial Base Stations: Self-Organizing Architecture and Approach.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2018.1700393", "year": "2018", "author": {"Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Fanqin Zhou": "137/4178", "Lei Feng 0001": "76/847-1", "Mengjun Yin": "152/1083", "Shaoyong Guo": "150/6843", "Zhipeng Gao": "25/2165", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": " Abstract:In 5G networks, an mAeBS can overcome on-ground constraints and enable rapid and flexible deployment, providing an ideal solution for CE in hotspot areas. However, how to control multiple mAeBSs for efficient CE is a challenging issue, and we refer to it as mACE. To tame the trivial management practices involved in mACE, we resort to the SON methodology and propose a self-organizing architecture. A closed-loop management process is correspondingly designed for it, which consists of four phases: analyzing, planning, devaluating, and executing. Thereafter, solutions to the key technical issues, including hotspot identification and mAeBS deployment, are investigated. The effects of the overall mACE approach are intuitively illustrated in a small-scale example case. A few more challenging issues related to mACE are also identified for future research."}, "journals/wicomm/YuZZLFQ18": {"title": "Self-Organized Cell Outage Detection Architecture and Approach for 5G H-CRAN.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/6201386", "year": "2018", "author": {"Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Fanqin Zhou": "137/4178", "Tao Zhang": "15/4777", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Lei Feng 0001": "76/847-1", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/access/ZhaoFYLQ17": {"title": "A Social-Aware Resource Allocation for 5G Device-to-Device Multicast Communication.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2731805", "year": "2017", "author": {"Pan Zhao 0002": "61/3903-2", "Lei Feng 0001": "76/847-1", "Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": " Abstract:With the ever-increasing demands for popular content sharing among humans, device-to-device (D2D) multicast communication, as a promising technology to support wireless services within a local area, is introduced in a 5G cellular network. However, the existing resource allocation approaches for D2D multicast communication usually consider only physical domain constraints but neglect social domain factors, which would result in ineffective D2D links between users unwilling to share interests. Different from existing works, the D2D multicast scheme proposed in this paper will produce effective D2D multicast links by sufficiently utilizing both the physical and social properties of mobile users, with the goal to maximize the throughput of the overall social-aware network and guarantee fairly allocation of the channel between different D2D multicast clusters. The scheme mainly consists of two parts, the formation of D2D multicast clusters and joint optimization of power and channel allocation. In the formation of D2D multicast clusters, members and head in each cluster are selected by taking into account both social attributes and physical factors, such as community, ties, and geographical closeness. In the joint optimization, a two-step scheme is designed to first calculate the optimal power allocation by geometric proximity and then select suitable cellular channels for each D2D multicast cluster utilizing an extended one-to-many bipartite graphs matching algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with heuristic algorithm and stochastic algorithm, the proposed scheme can increase the throughput of the overall social-aware network by about 5% and 50%, respectively."}, "journals/access/YinLFYQ17": {"title": "Multi-Cell Cooperative Outage Compensation in Cloud-RANs Based 5G Public Safety Network.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2734925", "year": "2017", "author": {"Mengjun Yin": "152/1083", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Lei Feng 0001": "76/847-1", "Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": "Topic: Mission Critical Public-Safety Communications: Architectures, Enabling Technologies, and Future Applications"}, "journals/iet-com/ZhouLFYM17": {"title": "Generalised benders decomposition-based load optimisation in cellular and public WLAN interworking network.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1049/iet-com.2016.0241", "year": "2017", "author": {"Fanqin Zhou": "137/4178", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Lei Feng 0001": "76/847-1", "Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Luoming Meng": "52/382"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/mis/YuFLQ16": {"title": "Energy-Saving Management Mechanism Based on Hybrid Energy Supplies for LTE Heterogeneous Networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/3121538", "year": "2016", "author": {"Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Lei Feng 0001": "76/847-1", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/mis/ZhouFYLM16": {"title": "Utility Maximization for Load Optimization in Cellular/WLAN Interworking Network Based on Generalized Benders Decomposition.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/6929575", "year": "2016", "author": {"Fanqin Zhou": "137/4178", "Lei Feng 0001": "76/847-1", "Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Luoming Meng": "52/382"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/mis/FengLYQ16": {"title": "An Enhanced OFDM Resource Allocation Algorithm in C-RAN Based 5G Public Safety Network.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2016/9586287", "year": "2016", "author": {"Lei Feng 0001": "76/847-1", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/sensors/FengGSYL16": {"title": "A Fault Tolerance Mechanism for On-Road Sensor Networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/s16122059", "year": "2016", "author": {"Lei Feng 0001": "76/847-1", "Shaoyong Guo": "150/6843", "Jialu Sun": "179/1695", "Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/itiis/YuFLLQ15": {"title": "Low-Complexity Energy Efficient Base Station Cooperation Mechanism in LTE Networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3837/tiis.2015.10.009", "year": "2015", "author": {"Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Lei Feng 0001": "76/847-1", "Zifan Li": "125/3616", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/itiis/FengLYQ14": {"title": "Modeling and Analysis of Load-Balancing Based on Base-Station CoMP with Guaranteed QoS.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3837/tiis.2014.09.002", "year": "2014", "author": {"Lei Feng 0001": "76/847-1", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Mengjun Yin": "152/1083", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": ""}}}
