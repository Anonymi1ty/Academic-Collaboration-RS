Utilizing the fact that artificial immune optimization and particle swarm optimization algorithms can compensate for each other, a hybrid immune particle swarm optimization algorithm is proposed and is used for the electromagnetic interference test optimized control in this paper. The implementation of this hybrid algorithm is discussed in detail. Then an optimized control strategy based on this hybrid algorithm is designed. Experiment results show that compared to control strategies using simulated annealing and genetic algorithm, the proposed strategy consumed much less time, and the number of sample searched is also much less."}}}
