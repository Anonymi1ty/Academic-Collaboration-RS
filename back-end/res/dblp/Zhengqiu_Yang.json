This system relies on the real-time grasp of important parameters such as SOC (State of Charge), polarization resistance and OCV by EKF (extended Kalman filter) battery algorithm. It is of great significance for drivers to grasp the follow-up mileage reasonably and to control the power of BMS. With the generation of massive data, the traditional EKF battery algorithm will encounter the bottleneck of time and space when running on a single machine and cannot meet the real-time requirements of streaming big data processing. In view of the above problems, the research on EKF battery algorithm under large-scale data sets is carried out. Based on the Spark Streaming real-time streaming data processing framework, the EKF battery algorithm is improved by setting batches and performing stateful operations, and the distributed calculation of this algorithm and the dynamic allocation of computing resources are realized. The intermediate results generated during the operation are all stored in memory, thus effectively reducing the I/O consumption of data and improving the efficiency of the algorithm.
