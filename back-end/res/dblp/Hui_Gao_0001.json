Traditional solutions adopt powerful channel codes for individual data protection, e.g., very low coding rate, to guarantee the identification performance, at the cost of sacrificing the real-time requirements. We propose to exploit the data correlation among users to perform cooperative identification. Specifically, by designing a convolutional neural network (CNN) based framework and constructing a combination of loss functions, a deep learning (DL) based multi-user semantic communication system for cooperative object identification, named DeepSC-COl, is proposed to fuse individual semantic features into a global feature through dynamically-tailored weights. In this way, multiple semantic features are jointly leveraged for identification without an extra increase of latency. Evaluation results show that the proposed DeepSC-COI outperforms the non-cooperative scheme with the performance gain of 86.9% at -3 dB, in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP)."}, "conf/iwcmc/HuL0022": {"title": "Heterogeneity-Aware Federated Learning for Device Anomaly Detection in Industrial loT.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC55113.2022.9824996", "year": "2022", "author": {"Zhuoer Hu": "286/9545", "Yueming Lu": "24/334", "Hui Gao 0001": "46/5223-1", "Wenjun Xu 0001": "14/2062-1"}, "abstract": " Abstract:With the popularity and application of the Industrial Internet of Things (1IoT), device anomaly detection is considered as one of the important challenges in IloT implementation.

To this end, this paper proposes two robust spectrum sensing schemes by leveraging the difference between the phase difference (PD) distribution of noise-perturbed signal and that of Gaussian noise. Specifically, the compact approximation of the PD distribution is first derived to enable the extraction of the features of PD distributions, which are robust to noise uncertainty and CF mismatch. Based on these features, two sensing schemes based on the deep neural network (DNN), referred to as DNN-based PD distribution detection (PDD) and blind PDD (BPDD), are proposed to detect spectrum holes in cases with known CF and unknown CF, respectively.

However, due to its potentially excessive computational complexity, at the time of writing the application of cooperative localization remains limited in practice. In this paper, we address the efficient cooperative positioning problem in wireless sensor networks. A space-time hierarchical-graph based scheme exhibiting fast convergence is proposed for localizing the agent nodes. In contrast to conventional methods, agent nodes are divided into different layers with the aid of the space-time hierarchical-model and their positions are estimated gradually. In particular, an information propagation rule is conceived upon considering the quality of positional information. According to the rule, the information always propagates from the upper layers to a certain lower layer and the message passing process is further optimized at each layer. Hence, the potential error propagation can be mitigated. Additionally, both position estimation and position broadcasting are carried out by the sensor nodes. Furthermore, a sensor activation mechanism is conceived, which is capable of significantly reducing both the energy consumption and the network traffic overhead incurred by the localization process.

A low complexity detection technique, termed symbol-based PNC (SPNC), is proposed for the relay. In particular, attributing to the outer product operation imposed on the superposed MPSK signals at the relay, SPNC obtains the network-coded symbol (NCS) straightforwardly without having to detect individual symbols separately. Unlike the optimal multi-user detector (MUD) which searches over the combinations of all users' modulation constellations, SPNC searches over only one modulation constellation, thus simplifies the NCS detection. Despite the reduced complexity, SPNC achieves full diversity in multi-antenna relay as the optimal MUD does. Specifically, antenna selection based SPNC (AS-SPNC) scheme and signal combining based SPNC (SC-SPNC) scheme are proposed. Our analysis of these two schemes not only confirms their full diversity performance, but also implies when SPNC is applied in multi-antenna relay, TWRC can be viewed as an effective single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system, in which AS-PNC and SC-PNC are equivalent to the general AS scheme and the maximal-ratio combining (MRC) scheme.

As the frame/symbol duration is shortened to boost data rate, interframe interference (IFI) or intersymbol interference (ISI) occurs and degrades the detection performance of CMSA. In this paper, an effective IFI/ISI premitigation scheme is proposed for CMSA through a code optimization approach. By employing a tailored interference model that highlights the codeword properties, the system performance in the presence of moderate IFI/ISI is evaluated, and the average collected channel gain is introduced as the metric for code optimization. With the primary focus on binary modulation, the following two IFI/ISI-robust code properties are generalized: 1) shifted orthogonality and 2) shifted repetition. Based on these properties, the optimal code is constructed. It is observed that, when the optimal code occurs, the leaked signal energy or the interference can partially be used to enhance the detection performance of CMSA in the presence of IFI/ISI. Unlike most of the existing IFI/ISI mitigation schemes for noncoherent UWB-IR, which mainly focus on signal processing after the nonlinear detector, the optimized code is exploited to aggregate the leaked signal energy, along with the linear predetection operation already involved in the CMSA receiver.

This paper proposes novel Max-Min optimization based relay antenna selection (RAS) schemes for zero-forcing (ZF) based MIMO-PNC transmission. RAS relaxes ZF's constraints on the number of antennas and extends the applications of ZF based MIMO-PNC to more practical scenarios, where the dedicated relay has more antennas than the end node. Moreover, RAS also brings diversity advantages to TWRN and the achievable diversity gains of the proposed schemes are theoretically analyzed. In particular, an equivalence relation is carefully built for the diversity gains obtained by 1) RAS for ZF based MIMO-PNC and 2) transmit antenna selection (TAS) for MIMO broadcasting (BC) with ZF receivers. This equivalence transforms the original problem to a more tractable form which eventually allows explicit analytical results. It is interesting to see that Max-Min RAS keeps the network diversity gain of ZF based MIMO-PNC to be the same as the diversity gain of the point-to-point link within the TWRN.
