In federated learning, system cannot fully control the behavior of clients which can be faulty. These behaviors include sharing arbitrary faulty gradients and delaying the process of sharing due to Byzantine attacks or clients’ own software and hardware failures. In federated learning, the parameter server may also be faulty during gradient collection and aggregation, mainly including gradient-based training data inference and model parameter faulty update. The above problems may lead to reduced accuracy of federated learning model training, leakage of client privacy, etc. Existing research enhances the robustness of federated learning by exploiting the decentralization and immutability of Blockchain. For untrusted clients, most research is based on Byzantine fault tolerance to defend against clients indiscriminately, and may cause model accuracy reduction. In addition, most of the research focus on unencrypted gradients, and there is insufficient research on dealing with client anomalies in the case of gradient encryption. For untrusted parameter servers, existing research has problems in energy overhead and scalability. Aiming at the problems above, this paper studies the robustness of federated learning, and proposes a blockchain-based federated learning parameter update architecture PUS-FL. Through experiments simulating distributed machine learning on neural networks, we demonstrate that the anomaly detection algorithm of PUS-FL outperforms conventional gradient filters including geometric median, Multi-Krum and trimmed mean. In addition, our experiments also verify that the scalability-enhanced parameter aggregation consensus algorithm proposed in this paper(SE-PBFT) improves consensus scalability by reducing communication complexity."}, "conf/icbct/LiuS21": {"title": "Secure Resource Sharing on Hyperledger Fabric based on CP-ABE.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3460537.3460541", "year": "2021", "author": {"Shu Liu": "57/1180", "Yanlei Shang": "59/4425"}, "abstract": "\n\t\tNowadays, Web services are becoming more and more common in people's lives. However, resources and services are coupled on the Web. That's to say, users have to expose their data to service providers in order to trade for Web services. Consequently, users lose control to their personal data, and undertake the hazard of data abuse and privacy leakage. Distributed resource sharing systems are dedicated to solving this problem, which typically face huge challenges in terms of access control mechanisms and data availability. Blockchain-based methods provide an effective solution, but mining consumes large computing power overhead and the accomplishment of access control mechanism is incomplete. In view of the above-mentioned challenges encountered in distributed resource sharing systems, we design a secure resource sharing architecture based on Hyperledger Fabric, and established a dedicated network and consensus mechanism to avoid unnecessary energy costs. We developed a fine-grained access control implementation plan for both acquisition and modification operations to flexibly realize the users’ unconditional control over personal data.

Therefore, this paper proposes a heterogeneous dynamic graph attention network (HDGAN), which attempts to use the attention mechanism to take the heterogeneity and dynamics of the network into account at the same time, so as to better learn network embedding. Our method is based on three levels of attention, namely structural-level attention, semantic-level attention and time-level attention. Structural-level attention pays attention to the network structure itself, and obtains the representation of structural-level nodes by learning the attention coefficients of neighbor nodes. Semantic-level attention integrates semantic information into the representation of nodes by learning the optimal weighted combination of different meta-paths. Time-level attention is based on the time decay effect, and the time feature is introduced into the node representation by neighborhood formation sequence. Through the above three levels of attention mechanism, the final network embedding can be obtained.Through experiments on two real-world heterogeneous dynamic networks, our models have the best results, proving the effectiveness of the HDGAN model."}, "conf/icsoc/LiuSDCLC15": {"title": "Optimizing Workload Category for Adaptive Workload Prediction in Service Clouds.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-662-48616-0_6", "year": "2015", "author": {"Chunhong Liu": "74/8350", "Yanlei Shang": "59/4425", "Li Duan": "72/6473", "Shiping Chen 0001": "65/287", "Chuanchang Liu": "00/3740", "Junliang Chen": "63/6051"}, "abstract": "It is important to predict the total workload for facilitating auto scaling resource management in service cloud platforms.

The auto-scaling mechanism combines the real-time scaling and the pre-scaling. Finally experimental results are provided to demonstrate that our approach can satisfy the user Service Level Agreement (SLA) while keeping scaling costs low."}, "journals/jcn/WuYSCC14": {"title": "SPMLD: Sub-packet based multipath load distribution for real-time multimedia traffic.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2014.000093", "year": "2014", "author": {"Jiyan Wu": "139/5744", "Jingqi Yang": "139/7938", "Yanlei Shang": "59/4425", "Bo Cheng 0001": "05/2700-1", "Junliang Chen": "63/6051"}, "abstract": " Abstract:Load distribution is vital to the performance of multipath transport. The task becomes more challenging in real-time multimedia applications (RTMA), which impose stringent delay requirements. Two key issues to be addressed are: 1) How to minimize end-to-end delay and 2) how to alleviate packet reordering that incurs additional recovery time at the receiver. In this paper, we propose sub-packet based multipath load distribution (SPMLD), a new model that splits traffic at the granularity of sub-packet. Our SPMLD model aims to minimize total packet delay by effectively aggregating multiple parallel paths as a single virtual path. First, we formulate the packet splitting over multiple paths as a constrained optimization problem and derive its solution based on progressive approximation method. Second, in the solution, we analyze queuing delay by introducing D/M/1 model and obtain the expression of dynamic packet splitting ratio for each path. Third, in order to describe SPMLD's scheduling policy, we propose two distributed algorithms respectively implemented in the source and destination nodes. We evaluate the performance of SPMLD through extensive simulations in QualNet using real-time H.264 video streaming. Experimental results demonstrate that: SPMLD outperforms previous flow and packet based load distribution models in terms of video peak signal-to-noise ratio, total packet delay, end-to-end delay, and risk of packet reordering. Besides, SPMLD's extra overhead is tiny compared to the input video streaming."}, "journals/jnca/WuCSHC14": {"title": "A novel scheduling approach to concurrent multipath transmission of high definition video in overlay networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnca.2014.05.003", "year": "2014", "author": {"Jiyan Wu": "139/5744", "Bo Cheng 0001": "05/2700-1", "Yanlei Shang": "59/4425", "Jun Huang": "51/5022", "Junliang Chen": "63/6051"}, "abstract": "Recent advancements in network infrastructures provide increased opportunities to support video delivery over multiple communication paths.

However, the burst loss in the unreliable wireless channels is a severely challenging problem which significantly degrades the effectiveness of bandwidth aggregation. Previous studies mainly address the critical problem by reactively increasing the forward error correction (FEC) redundancy. In this paper, we propose a loss tolerant bandwidth aggregation approach (LTBA), which proactively leverages the channel diversity in heterogeneous wireless networks to overcome the burst loss. First, we allocate the FEC packets according to the ‘loss-free’ bandwidth of each wireless network to the multihomed client. Second, we deliberately insert intervals between the FEC packets’ departures while still respecting the delay constraint. The proposed LTBA is able to reduce the consecutive packet loss under burst loss assumption. We carry out analysis to prove that the proposed LTBA outperforms the existing ‘back-to-back’ transmission schemes based on Gilbert loss model and continuous time Markov chain.
