However, the main challenge in the teaching evaluation is that the teacher in class cannot timely, objectively and accurately evaluate each student's state of listening in accordance with the facial expression or behavior of the students. Along with the advance of deep learning algorithms, artificial intelligence technology is more and more widely applied in the field of education. Based on the above challenges, this paper proposes an intelligent teaching evaluation method that integrates student facial expressions and behaviors in teaching videos, designs and implements a deep learning based intelligent teaching evaluation system. We construct the face detection and recognition model based on deep convolutional neural network and triple loss function to realize the detection and recognition of face regions of students. And then the student facial expression recognition model and the student behavior recognition model based on the deep separable convolutional neural network are constructed. Finally, we propose a novel comprehensive teaching evaluation algorithm by fusion of the student facial expression and behavior, aiming at calculating the comprehensive evaluation value and obtain the corresponding evaluation level. Also, we construct the first teaching video database, student facial expression database and student behavior database for intelligent teaching evaluation. In this paper, the evaluation of students fully combines the students' specific facial expressions under certain behaviors in the classroom. Therefore, the final teaching assessment results are more comprehensive and accurate."}, "conf/bigcomp/WangLCD21": {"title": "Dual-pathway Attention based Supervised Adversarial Hashing for Cross-modal Retrieval.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/BigComp51126.2021.00040", "year": "2021", "author": {"Xiaoxiao Wang 0006": "01/447-6", "MeiYu Liang": "150/1513", "Xiaowen Cao": "154/5940", "Junping Du": "13/1151"}, "abstract": " Abstract:Due to the success of deep learning in recent years, cross-modal retrieval has made significant progress.

The main reason is that the differences between long and short texts in scientific paper search have not been fully considered, and the structural information of the text will be lost when the length difference is large. In order to solve the above long-short scientific text matching problem, we propose a multi-view relevance matching model (MVRM) of scientific papers based on graph convolutional network and attention mechanism. First, we use scientific papers abstract to construct interactive graph to retain the structural information in the long text.

Second, we propose a matching network for interactive graph based on the graph convolution networks. Multiple keywords in the search term form multiple views, and each keyword under each view interacts with the interactive graph. Then the interaction feature vectors from multiple views are generated through graph convolution network. Finally, attention mechanism is used for fusion, and the final matching result is output through the multilayer perceptron.

To solve the problems of feature heterogeneity and semantic gap of different media data, existing deep cross-media quantization technology provides an efficient and effective solution for cross-media common semantic representation learning. However, due to the fact that social network data often exhibits semantic sparsity, diversity, and contains a lot of noise, the performance of existing cross-media search methods often degrades. To address the above issue, this paper proposes a novel fine-grained cross-media representation learning model with deep quantization attention network for social network cross-media search (CMSL). First, we construct the image-word semantic correlation graph, and perform deep random walks on the graph to realize semantic expansion and semantic embedding learning, which can discover some potential semantic correlations between images and words. Then, in order to discover more fine-grained cross-media semantic correlations, a multi-scale fine-grained cross-media semantic correlation learning method that combines global and local saliency semantic similarity is proposed. Third, the fine-grained cross-media representation, cross-media semantic correlations and binary quantization code are jointly learned by a unified deep quantization attention network, which can preserve both inter-media correlations and intra-media similarities, by minimizing both cross-media correlation loss and binary quantization loss. Experimental results demonstrate that CMSL can generate high-quality cross-media common semantic representation, which yields state-of-the-art cross-media search performance on two benchmark datasets, NUS-WIDE and MIR-Flickr 25k.\n\t"}, "conf/ccis/LiDLLM16": {"title": "Video super-resolution based on nonlinear mapping and patch similarity.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/CCIS.2016.7790223", "year": "2016", "author": {"Linghui Li": "19/10136", "Junping Du": "13/1151", "MeiYu Liang": "150/1513", "Jangmyung Lee": "130/8653", "Luoming Meng": "52/382"}, "abstract": " Abstract:Aiming at recovering lost detailed information in low-resolution videos, a novel video super-resolution algorithm based on nonlinear mapping and patch similarity was proposed in this paper.

Deep hash networks have shown high potential in achieving efficient and effective cross-media search performance. However, due to the fact that social network data often exhibit text sparsity, diversity, and noise characteristics, the search performance of existing methods often degrades when dealing with this data. In order to address this problem, this article proposes a novel end-to-end cross-media semantic correlation learning model based on a deep hash network and semantic expansion for social network cross-media search (DHNS). The approach combines deep network feature learning and hash-code quantization learning for multimodal data into a unified optimization architecture, which successfully preserves both intramedia similarity and intermedia correlation, by minimizing both cross-media correlation loss and binary hash quantization loss. In addition, our approach realizes semantic relationship expansion by constructing the image-word relation graph and mining the potential semantic relationship between images and words, and obtaining the semantic embedding based on both internal graph deep walk and an external knowledge base. Experimental results demonstrate that DHNS yields better cross-media search performance on standard benchmarks."}, "journals/www/ZhouDYCXL20": {"title": "A content search method for security topics in microblog based on deep reinforcement learning.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11280-019-00697-7", "year": "2020", "author": {"Nan Zhou": "06/5140", "Junping Du": "13/1151", "Xu Yao": "118/3673", "Wanqiu Cui": "223/2328", "Zhe Xue": "116/7294", "MeiYu Liang": "150/1513"}, "abstract": "Traditional methods treat the search problem as a process of selecting and ranking sequential documents.

As the texts of social media messages are usually so short, when traditional existing document modeling methods are used in social network search tasks, the problem of semantic sparsity arises, leading to low-quality semantic representation and low-precision social network search results. Fortunately, besides of short text, social media data also has other features, such as timestamps, locations, and its user information. In light of this, to realize precise social network search, we propose a multi-feature probabilistic graphical model (MFPGM), which can generate high-quality semantic representation. To deal with the problem of semantic sparsity, we exploit two strategies in MFPGM. First, we propose a concept named special region and utilize location information to aggregate short text into long text. Second, we introduce the biterm pattern that can generate dense semantic space by supposing that a biterm occurring in the same context has the same topic. In order to generate high-quality semantic representations, we simultaneously model multiple features (i.e., biterm, user, location and timestamp) of social network data to enhance the semantic learning process of MFPGM. We conduct a lot of experiments on real-word datasets, and the comparisons with several state-of-art baseline methods have demonstrated the superiority of our MFPGM on topic quality and search performance.

In this study, we propose dynamic topic modeling via a self-aggregation method (SADTM) that can capture the time-varying aspect of topic distributions and resolve the sparsity problem. The SADTM aggregates the observable and unordered short texts as the aggregated document without leveraging an external context to overcome the sparsity problem of short text. Furthermore, we exploit word pairs instead of words for each microblog to generate more word co-occurrence patterns. The SADTM models temporal dynamics by using the topic distribution at previous time steps in microblog streams to infer the current topic from sequential data. Extensive experiments on a real-world Sina microblog dataset demonstrate that our SADTM algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in topic coherence and cluster quality. Additionally, when applied in a search scene, our SADTM significantly outperforms all baseline methods in terms of the quality of the search results."}, "journals/prl/WeiDLY19": {"title": "Boosting deep attribute learning via support vector regression for fast moving crowd counting.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2017.12.002", "year": "2019", "author": {"Xinlei Wei": "195/7472", "Junping Du": "13/1151", "MeiYu Liang": "150/1513", "Lingfei Ye": "192/0991"}, "abstract": "Crowd counting has recently attracted extensive attention in research.

Congestion, stampedes, fights and other tourism emergency events occurred frequently, which should be a wake-up call for tourism security. Therefore, it is of great research value and application prospect to real-time monitor tourists and detect abnormal events in tourism surveillance video by using computer vision and video intelligent processing technology, which can realize the timely forecast and early warning of tourism emergencies. At present, although most of the video-based abnormal event detection methods work well in simple scenes, there are often problems such as low detection rate and high false positive rate in complex motion scenarios, and the detection of abnormal events canâ€™t be processed in real time. To tackle these issues, we propose an abnormal event detection model in tourism video based on salient spatio-temporal features and sparse combination learning, which has good robustness and timeliness in complex motion scenarios and can be adapted to real-time anomaly detection in practical applications. Specifically, spatio-temporal gradient model is combined with foreground detection to extract 3D gradient features on the foreground target of video sequence as the salient spatio-temporal features, which can eliminate the interference of the background. Sparse combination learning algorithm is used to establish the abnormal event detection model, which can realize the real-time detection of abnormal events. In addition, we construct a new ScenicSpot dataset with 18 video clips (5964 frames) containing both normal and abnormal events. The experimental results on ScenicSpot dataset and two standard benchmark datasets show that our method can realize the automatic detection and recognition of touristsâ€™ abnormal behavior, and has better performance compared with the classical methods."}, "journals/www/CuiDWKLXZ19": {"title": "Extended search method based on a semantic hashtag graph combining social and conceptual information.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11280-018-0584-z", "year": "2019", "author": {"Wanqiu Cui": "223/2328", "Junping Du": "13/1151", "Dawei Wang": "39/2537", "Feifei Kou": "223/2313", "MeiYu Liang": "150/1513", "Zhe Xue": "116/7294", "Nan Zhou": "06/5140"}, "abstract": "Searching for microblog short text by their meaning is a challenging task because of the semantic sparsity of the information in social networks.

First, our HRMF expands short text into long text, and then it simultaneously models multi-features (i.e., user, hashtag, text) of microblogs by designing a new topic model. To further alleviate the data sparsity problem, HRMF exploits hashtags of both similar users and similar microblogs as the candidate hashtags. In particular, to find similar users, HRMF combines the designed topic model with typical user-based collaborative filtering method.
