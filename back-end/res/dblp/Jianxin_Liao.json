For the conventional scheme, tremendous Machine Type Communication Devices (MTCDs) send short status update packets directly to the central Base Station (BS) using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which leads to a huge burden on the BS and may cause severe communication congestion. To solve this problem, we propose a frame-level data aggregation SPC scheme based on the Quick UDP Internet Connection (QUIC) protocol. By using the stream multiplexing feature of QUIC, some MTCDs selected as aggregators receive the short status update packets from their neighboring MTCDs, pack the data into new QUIC packets, and forward these new packets to the BS. The QUIC-based SPC scheme is evaluated in the 5G network environment. It is proved that our scheme reduces the communication overhead of the BS by about 10% and the computing burden of the BS by average 40% in CPU usage."}, "conf/mir/Zhu0Z0SL22": {"title": "FedNKD: A Dependable Federated Learning Using Fine-tuned Random Noise and Knowledge Distillation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3512527.3531372", "year": "2022", "author": {"Shaoxiong Zhu": "322/8825", "Qi Qi 0001": "80/6406-1", "Zirui Zhuang": "235/7014", "Jingyu Wang 0001": "37/2749-1", "Haifeng Sun 0001": "00/11044-1", "Jianxin Liao": "60/4951"}, "abstract": "\n\t\tMultimedia retrieval models need the ability to extract useful information from large-scale data for clients. As an important part of multimedia retrieval, image classification model directly affects the efficiency and effect of multimedia retrieval. We need a lot of data to train a image classification model applied to multimedia retrieval task. However, with the protection of data privacy, the data used to train the model often needs to be kept on the client side. Federated learning is proposed to use data from all clients to train one model while protecting privacy. When federated learning is applied, the distribution of data across different clients varies greatly. Disregarding this problem yields a final model with unstable performance. To enable federated learning to work dependably in the real world with complex data environments, we propose FedNKD, which utilizes knowledge distillation and random noise. The superior knowledge of each client is distilled into a central server to mitigate the instablity caused by Non-IID data. Importantly, a synthetic dataset is created by some random noise through back propagation of neural networks. The synthetic dataset will contain the abstract features of the real data. Then we will use this synthetic dataset to realize the knowledge distillation while protecting users' privacy.

However, due to the limited computational resource of VR/AR equipment, the reconstruction algorithm must balance accuracy and efficiency to make the users have a good experience. Nevertheless, current methods are not doing well in balancing accuracy and efficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework that can achieve a fast and accurate 3D hand reconstruction. Our framework relies on three essential modules, including spatial-aware initial graph building (SAIGB), graph convolutional network (GCN) based belief maps regression (GBBMR), and pose-guided refinement (PGR). At first, given image feature maps extracted by convolutional neural networks, SAIGB builds a spatial-aware and compact initial feature graph. Each node in this graph represents a vertex of the mesh and has vertex-specific spatial information that is helpful for accurate and efficient regression. After that, GBBMR first utilizes adaptive-GCN to introduce interactions between vertices to capture short-range and long-range dependencies between vertices efficiently and flexibly. Then, it maps vertices’ features to belief maps that can model the uncertainty of predictions for more accurate predictions. Finally, we apply PGR to compress the redundant vertices’ belief maps to compact-joints’ belief maps with the pose guidance and use these joints’ belief maps to refine previous predictions better to obtain more accurate and robust reconstruction results. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public benchmarks, FreiHAND, HO-3D, RHD, and STB.

Specifically, a fixed feature vector is directly adopted to evaluate its abnormality without considering the node’s diverse roles when interacting with different neighbors.

DeepHop determines the routing among edge network nodes for heterogeneous types of traffic according to the current workload and capability. By joining with an attention mechanism, DeepHop obtains the semantics from the elements of the network state to help the agents learn the importance of each element on routing. Experiment results show that DeepHop achieves the increase of successfully transmitted packets by 15% compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Besides, DeepHop with an attention mechanism reduces convergence time by nearly half compared with the common-used structures of neural networks.\n\t"}, "conf/iwqos/Zhuang00LH20": {"title": "Adaptive and Robust Network Routing Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning with Lyapunov Optimization.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/IWQoS49365.2020.9213056", "year": "2020", "author": {"Zirui Zhuang": "235/7014", "Jingyu Wang 0001": "37/2749-1", "Qi Qi 0001": "80/6406-1", "Jianxin Liao": "60/4951", "Zhu Han 0001": "83/514"}, "abstract": " Abstract:The most recent development of the Internet of Things brings massive timely-sensitive and yet bursty data flows. The adaptive network control has been explored using deep reinforcement learning, but it is not sufficient for extremely bursty network traffic flows, especially when the network traffic pattern may change over time. We model the routing control in an environment with time-variant link delays as a Lyapunov optimization problem. We identify that there is a tradeoff between optimization performance and modeling accuracy when the propagation delays are included. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based adaptive network routing method to tackle the issues mentioned above. A Lyapunov optimization technique is used to reduce the upper bound of the Lyapunov drift, which leads to improved queuing stability in networked systems. Experiment results show that the proposed method can learn a routing control policy and adapt to the changing environment. The proposed method outperforms the baseline backpressure method in multiple settings, and converges faster than existing methods. Moreover, the deep reinforcement learning module can effectively learn a better estimation of the longterm Lyapunov drift and penalty functions, and thus it provides superior results in terms of the backlog size, end-to-end latency, age of information, and throughput.

Most studies about parallel task scheduling focused on formulating special scenarios and service requirements as optimization problems. However, the complicated and dynamic parallel computing environments are hard to model, predict and control, making those previous methods unscalable and unable to reflect the real scenarios. In this paper, a Multi-task Deep reinforcement learning approach for scalable parallel Task Scheduling (MDTS) is firstly devised. Generally, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a model-free optimization algorithm for long-term control by leveraging experience, but it suffers the curse of dimensionality for decision when coping with complex parallel computing environments and jobs with diverse properties. We extend the action selection in DRL to a multi-task decision, where the output branches of multitask learning are fine-matched to parallel scheduling tasks. Child tasks of a job are accordingly assigned to distributed nodes without any human knowledge while the resource competition among parallel tasks is leveraged through shared neural network layers. Extensive experiments show that the MDTS significantly reduces the job execution time compared with least-connection scheduling and particle swarm optimization algorithm by 15.3% and 39.8% respectively.

Traditional TCP protocol does not work well to meet the demand in data center. Before congestion occurs, TCP increases sending window to preempt bandwidth, resulting in buildup queues and increase latency, moreover TCP can only adjust sending window individually for each flow, which lacks global information. This mechanism is ill-suited for the diverse mix of short and long flows, and cannot provide high burst tolerance. Fortunately, Software Defined Networking (SDN) has a global view on data center network, which provides an opportunity to centralized control flows. Leveraging the feature of SDN, we propose an explicit centralized congestion avoidance mechanism (ECTCP). By gaining network topology and the information of flows, SDN controller calculates each flow's fair bandwidth, and adjusts the receive window size of each TCP connection. ECTCP does not need to modify TCP stack, which is easy to implement in the SDN-based data center.

In order to overcome the inefficiency of NEP, we define a non-transferable utility (NTU) game based on Shapley NTU game theory, in which overlays and TE share cost efficiently and fairly without side payment, and we propose an algorithm to calculate the Shapley NTU value (SNTUV)."}, "conf/icdm/FangGLLL15": {"title": "Cross-Domain Recommendation via Tag Matrix Transfer.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2015.133", "year": "2015", "author": {"Zhou Fang": "56/7625", "Sheng Gao": "35/5676", "Bo Li": "50/3402", "Juncen Li": "175/5326", "Jianxin Liao": "60/4951"}, "abstract": " Abstract:Data sparseness is one of the most challenging problems in collaborative filtering(CF) based recommendation systems.

However, a major challenge is how to map multiple virtual networks, with specific node and link constraints, onto the shared substrate network, known as virtual network embedding problem. By taking topology attribute into account, topology-aware virtual network embedding algorithms efficiently improve the performance by leveraging a node ranking method based on Markov chain. However, as the basis of node ranking, the resource evaluation of node which is calculated as the product of its CPU and bandwidth may be incorrect. Moreover, a greedy matching strategy is always applied in the node mapping stage, which may lead to unnecessary bandwidth consumption by ignoring the relationships between the mapped substrate nodes and the mapping one.

Since the frequent communication between the server and workers is very expensive, it is desired to accelerate the learning process. The gradient sparsification is an efficient method that only uploads a small subset of gradient elements. However, most existing works neglect the distributed nature of local datasets, and consequently the local gradients uploaded by edge devices cannot follow the global correct optimization direction well, which results in the loss of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new gradient sparsification with a renovating mechanism, called Global Renovating Stochastic Gradient Descent (GRSGD). GRSGD utilizes the previous-round global gradient to estimate the current global one and renovates the current zero-sparsified local gradients. It mitigates the communication overhead while making the convergence direction of training closer to the global optimization, accelerating the distributed edge learning process. We provide a theoretical convergence guarantee for our algorithm based on the non-convex assumption, which better fits most deep learning problems. With extensive experiments in PyTorch, we show that GRSGD effectively accelerates the learning process with a smaller communication cost and a faster convergence rate on most training tasks.

Traditional extractive methods are difficult to extract all predefined key points exactly.

However, deploying deep neural networks into real-world applications is still challenging due to their high computational complexity and storage overhead. Fortunately, a densely connected neural network can be converted into a sparsely connected network with low resource demand by the neural network compression. Since deep neural networks are complicated, compression mechanism should find a tradeoff between compression ratio and model accuracy. In this article, by analyzing the statistics of channel connection, we propose an interactive neural network compression mechanism including out-in-channel pruning and neural network quantization. Many channel pruning works apply structured sparsity regularization on each layer separately. We consider correlations between successive layers to retain predictive power of the compact network. A global greedy pruning algorithm is designed to remove redundant out-in-channels in an iterative way. Moreover, in order to solve the shortcomings of the one-shot quantization, we propose the incremental quantization algorithm in the dimension of the output channel, which can smooth network fluctuations and recover accuracy better during retraining. Our mechanism is comprehensively evaluated with various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures on popular datasets. Notably, on ImageNet-1K, the out-in-channel pruning reduce 54.0 percent FLOPS on AlexNet and 50.0 percent FLOPs on ResNet-50 with only 0.15 and 0.37 percent top-1 accuracy drop respectively.

Child tasks of a job are accordingly assigned to distributed nodes without any human knowledge while the resource competition among parallel tasks is leveraged through shared neural network layers.

This paper mostly formulate the offloading decision as a resource scheduling problem with single or multiple objective function and constraints, where some customized heuristics algorithms are explored. However, offloading multiple data dependence tasks in a complex service is a difficult decision, as an optimal solution must understand the resource requirement, the access network, the user mobility, and importantly the data dependence.

However, these heuristic algorithms have the drawback of being easily trapped in local optimal solutions and consuming high time. In this paper, we propose an approach named as Density Based Controller Placement (DBCP), which uses a density-based switch clustering algorithm to split the network into several sub-networks. As switches are tightly connected within the same sub-network and less connected from the switches in other sub-networks, we deploy one controller in each sub-network. In DBCP, the size of each sub-network can be decided by the capacity of the controller deployed. Moreover, the optimal number of controllers is obtained according to the density-based clustering. We evaluate DBCP’s performance on a set of 262 publicly available network topologies. The experimental results show that DBCP provides better performance than the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of time consumption, propagation latency, and fault tolerance."}, "journals/itiis/TianLLWC17": {"title": "Resilient Routing Overlay Network Construction with Super-Relay Nodes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3837/tiis.2017.04.005", "year": "2017", "author": {"Shengwen Tian": "42/2738", "Jianxin Liao": "60/4951", "Tonghong Li": "98/4254", "Jingyu Wang 0001": "37/2749-1", "Guanghai Cui": "119/3626"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/winet/LiaoZLWQ17": {"title": "A generalized design of distributed rateless codes with decreasing ripple size for multiple-access relay networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11276-016-1279-y", "year": "2017", "author": {"Jianxin Liao": "60/4951", "Lei Zhang 0094": "97/8704-94", "Tonghong Li": "98/4254", "Jingyu Wang 0001": "37/2749-1", "Qi Qi 0001": "80/6406-1"}, "abstract": "In this correspondence, the problem of existing distributed rateless codes (DRC) with inaccurate degree distributions in the sources and the relay is addressed.

A long-standing challenge in network virtualization is how to effectively map these virtual networks onto the shared substrate network, known as the virtual network embedding (VNE) problem. Most heuristic VNE algorithms find practical solutions by leveraging a greedy matching strategy in node mapping. However, greedy node mapping may lead to unnecessary bandwidth consumption and increased network fragmentation because it ignores the relationships between the mapped virtual network requests and the mapping ones. In this paper, we re-visit the VNE problem from a statistical perspective and explore the potential dependencies between every two substrate nodes. We define a well-designed dependency matrix that represents the importance of substrate nodes and the topological relationships between them, i.e., every substrate node’s degree of belief. Based on the dependency matrix generated from collecting and processing records of accepted virtual network requests, Bayesian inference is leveraged to iteratively select the most suitable substrate nodes and realize our novel statistical VNE algorithm consisting of a learning stage and an inference stage in node mapping. Due to the overall consideration of the relationships between the mapped nodes and the mapping ones, our statistical approach reduces unnecessary bandwidth consumption and achieves a better performance of embedding.
