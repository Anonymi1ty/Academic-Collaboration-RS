Network traffic forecasting enables network operators to adjust usage demands in real-time, thereby rationally allocating network resources. Based on the characteristics of high nonlinearity and dynamic spatial-temporal correlation of network traffic data, a graph neural network and temporal extracting modules need to be used to extract temporal and spatial features separately. Existing works usually have some common problems: (1) the use of single-channel input data makes the data feature extraction relatively single. (2) construct graphs only through spatial relationships, lacking consideration of non-spatial relationships. Therefore, we propose a new graph convolutional neural network approach: Multi-Channel Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks. Specifically, we do time slicing in the data pre-processing stage, to slice the data with different time dimensions to construct the adjacency matrix. To construct the graph from different angles, functional adjacency matrix and temporal adjacency matrix are introduced.

Ordinary mobile devices can not meet the large-scale data processing scenarios and need more computing and storage resources to deal with complex tasks. Cloud data centre has strong computing resources and storage capacity. The mobile edge network can be formed by migrating the computing resources of cloud data centre to the network edge side. By comprehensively considering the parameters of task type, task size, communication environment, server resources and server power, the resources are jointly allocated and the reasonable offloading decision is made. The computing tasks are offloaded to the edge server, so as to achieve the effect of saving energy, reducing delay and improving efficiency. This paper mainly uses clustering algorithm and KM algorithm to develop the offloading algorithm. Firstly, the terminal tasks are classified by clustering algorithm and the appropriate terminal tasks are selected to match with the edge server. Secondly, the KM algorithm is used for bipartite graph matching to find the appropriate edge server for each terminal task to offload, then the overall offloading cost is minimized.

Another problem is that resource shortages or hardware failures of these edge networks can affect the service migration policy. In this paper, a novel service migration method based on state adaptation and deep reinforcement learning is proposed to efficiently overcome network failures. Before migration, we define four edge network states to discuss the migration policy and adopt the two-dimensional movement around the edge servers to adapt to the applications scenarios of our work. Then, we use the satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) method to solve the candidate space of migration policies based on cost constraints, delay constraints and available resource capacity constraints to shorten the interruption time. Finally, the service migration problem can be transformed into the optimal destination server and low-cost migration path problem based on the Markov decision process by the deep Q-learning (DQN) algorithm. Moreover, we theoretically prove the rate of convergence in the learning rate function of our algorithm to improve the convergence rate.

Inspired by information-centric networking (ICN), content-centric VANETs have emerged as a promising architecture to address the challenges of traditional IP-based communications in VANETs. However, several issues need to be solved with regard to this architecture. Among them, inflexible routing schemata based on IP addresses, inefficient traffic caused by network broadcast, and volatility in the network environment cause low network performance in VANETs. By focusing on the content routing of the VANETs, we propose a multiple unicast path-forwarding scheme, MUPF, in which we aim to build multiple stable unicast forwarding paths in content-centric VANETs. The main design concepts of MUPF are as follows: (1) By introducing the idea of ICN, we avoid using the fixed-communication “host-to-host” method employed in IP; MUPF applies a content-centric routing process to request for and reply to packets. (2) We have evaluated the often-occurring broadcast in VANETs, which is thought to have a bad impact on network performance; hence, MUPF uses multiple unicast forwarding paths to deliver the packets instead of a simple broadcast. (3) Considering the highly volatile feature of VANETs, wherein the links are easily broken when the nodes leave, combined with the nodes’ motion parameters and link quality metrics, MUPF can choose some more reliable nodes as next hops to improve the time tolerance of each routing path. In terms of average response time, the performance improvement achieved by MUPF is ∼10%, 15–20%, and 60% compared to CCVN, V-NDN, and TCP/IP, respectively.

The service requester calculates the direct trust degree and the recommended trust degree of the backup devices, then uses the evidence combination rule to calculate the comprehensive trust degree. The backup device with the highest trust value will be seclected to recover the service. The simulation results show that this method effectively improves the packet delivery ratio, reduces the service execution time and provides users with more stable multimedia contents."}, "journals/ieicet/HuangRZNQS16": {"title": "General, Practical and Accurate Models for the Performance Analysis of Multi-Cache Systems.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1587/transcom.2016CNP0012", "year": "2016", "author": {"Haoqiu Huang": "168/7949", "Lanlan Rui": "03/4227", "Weiwei Zheng": "176/0935", "Danmei Niu": "68/10365", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342", "Sujie Shao": "151/6228"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/ijdsn/RuiZHQ16": {"title": "A location-dependent task assignment mechanism in vehicular crowdsensing.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1550147716669627", "year": "2016", "author": {"Lanlan Rui": "03/4227", "Pan Zhang": "29/1005", "Haoqiu Huang": "168/7949", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/cj/NiuRZQ15": {"title": "A Composition and Recovery Strategy for Mobile Social Network Service in Disaster.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/comjnl/bxu044", "year": "2015", "author": {"Danmei Niu": "68/10365", "Lanlan Rui": "03/4227", "Cheng Zhong": "07/1405", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/ejwcn/YangLGQRL15": {"title": "A data dissemination mechanism for motorway environment in VANETs.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13638-015-0310-9", "year": "2015", "author": {"Yang Yang 0006": "48/450-6", "Qian Liu": "33/85", "Zhipeng Gao": "25/2165", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342", "Lanlan Rui": "03/4227", "Xin Li": "09/1365"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/ahswn/GuoRQM14": {"title": "Service-Oriented Synergy Mechanism Among Multi-Devices in Ubiquitous Network.", "url": "http://www.oldcitypublishing.com/journals/ahswn-home/ahswn-issue-contents/ahswn-volume-23-number-1-2-2014/ahswn-23-1-2-p-137-157/", "year": "2014", "author": {"Shao-Yong Guo": "150/6843", "Lanlan Rui": "03/4227", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342", "Luoming Meng": "52/382"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/sensors/HuangQR11": {"title": "Simple Random Sampling-Based Probe Station Selection for Fault Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/s110303117", "year": "2011", "author": {"Rimao Huang": "57/10696", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342", "Lanlan Rui": "03/4227"}, "abstract": ""}}}
