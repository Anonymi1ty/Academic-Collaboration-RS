As mature and widely used inter-domain routing protocols, BGP-based solutions often use the number of domains (i.e. AS hops) of each path to make inter-domain routing decisions, which is simple and effective, but usually can not get the optimal routing results due to the lack of real state/information within ASes. These protocols choose the path with less AS hops as the forwarding path, even if the total latency or cost of the domains on this path is higher. While to solve this problem, directly access to intra-domain information as the assistance to make routing decisions is impractical due to data privacy.In this paper, we propose DIT, which makes near-optimal inter-domain routing decisions with desensitized intra-domain information. To do so, we design a homomorphic encrypted-based private number comparison scheme to export intra-domain information securely and thus assist in routing decisions. We conduct a series of experiments according to five real network topologies with nearly 900 simulated flows, and the results show that DIT reduces the number of forwarding hops by about 45% in average and reduces flow completion time by about 60%."}, "conf/icc/ZhangZGW21": {"title": "FreeVM: A Server Release Algorithm in DataCenter Network.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ICC42927.2021.9500959", "year": "2021", "author": {"Shiyan Zhang": "213/2777", "Yuchao Zhang": "42/7674", "Xiangyang Gong": "04/8431", "Ran Wang": "12/6277"}, "abstract": " Abstract:With the development of 5G access technology and the corresponding explosive growth of user requests, service providers have to activate more and more physical machines (PM) in cloud datacenters.

However, with the rapid development of the Internet in recent years, IP addresses are facing more and more problems, such as address exhaustion, low packet efficiency and low flexibility. The reason is that IP addresses use a fixed-length design and lack extensibility. The New IP network architecture and addressing method were born to solve these problems. Based on this architecture, the addressing scheme adopts variable-length and structured addresses. The address space can be smoothly expanded according to the network scale without modifying the old network address configuration. But there are some challenges about New IP, and the greatest one lies in the route lookup of variable-length IP addresses. Content Addressable Memories (CAMs) are widely used in high speed routers to find matching routes for packets in a routing table. They enable the longest prefix matching on fixed-length addresses to be completed in a single clock cycle. However, they can not deal with New IP prefixes with variable lengths directly. In this paper, we propose a mechanism using Binary CAMs (BCAMs) and Ternary CAMs (TCAMs) to efficiently store New IP addresses and complete a route lookup in constant time. Moreover, we combine the hash scheme and CAMs matching scheme to shorten the extremely long New IP addresses and reduce TCAM storage space consumption.

There may be multiple videos for different resolutions displayed on one screen. A consistent way is needed to assess the users' QoE of the split-screen service. The second challenge is how to choose bitrate of each video stream to maximize users' QoE of the split-screen service. Multiple video streams are transmitted to user over resource-constrained wireless networks. Therefore, it is a difficult issue to select an appropriate bitrate for every video streaming. To address these challenges, in this paper, we first present a dynamic adaptive video transmission scheme (DAVTS) based on MPEG Media Transport (MMT) protocol. Then we introduce a novel mathematical model for characterizing users' QoE to be affected by some factors in the proposed DAVTS. In the model, the objective method of QoE assessment of split-screen service is proposed. Based on the model a problem of maximum income in QoE of users is considered.

However, to date, most existing pedestrian localization methods rely on a fixed external infrastructure, such as a global positioning system(GPS) or pre-deployed wifi access points to provide Localization service for mobile devices. Such methods are constrained either by limited GPS coverage or by complicated set-up procedures. We observe that, when two devices are moving, the change of their positions leads to the change of distance between them. Given the same movements, different relative locations between devices lead to different distance changes. Besides, the distance between and relative movement of devices can be measured by two phone-embedded sensors respectively. This motivates us to exploit the relative localization method by merely two mobile devices. In this work, we present Phone-Radar, which is an infrastructure-free device-to-device localization system. According to the propagation model of wireless signals, the change of distance between devices are modeled by the change of wireless signal strength between them. The movements of devices are recorded by the inertial sensors using step-counting method.

Air quality is a part of the Chinese weather forecast, and the government has developed air quality monitoring systems and built high-quality monitoring stations (HQMS). With the data from HQMS, many companies and research institutes demonstrate an accurate air pollution map on the Internet, which is valuable for many issues related to air quality, including exposure modeling and urban planning. Due to the high equipment and operating costs, the distribution of HQMS is too uneven and sparse to achieve a high-resolution air pollution map. Thus, people try to deploy a large number of high precision sensors in and around the city for detecting air pollution. However, these sensors require frequent calibrations with the HQMS to maintain data accuracy. On the other side, to reduce the cost of sensor deployment, people begin to use mobile sensors instead of fixed sensors, which make sensor route planning a very important issue. Nevertheless, existing works on the route planning of mobile sensors largely focus on data reconstruction, which either ignores calibration or views it as an independent problem. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to improve the accuracy of data reconstruction, which jointly considers sensor calibration and data reconstruction in route planning for mobile sensors. We formulate a novel sensor route planning problem (SRPP) that aims to maximize the mutual information and guarantee the accuracy of measurements through the sensor calibration.

Previous research efforts tried to complete the reconfiguration as quickly as possible, since the update speed is critical to the performance of network management.

Then, we propose a scheme called USA (i.e., Update Speed Accelerator), as a novel algorithm for network updates based on the above-mentioned rule co-existence, that accelerates the update of forwarding policy with spare rule space on current network switches for general IoT environments. Based on the obtained suboptimal greedy solution, USA shows a novel way for rule co-existence to accelerate the update of forwarding policies. It also proposes a simplified algorithm to ensure the forwarding correctness during the update process. Extensive simulation results show that USA can clearly reduce the update time for nearly half of policies in our experiments with few rule space overhead, which is less than 8% of all policies, and maximum update time is less than previous works when spare rule space is limited."}, "journals/ijdsn/0006TGQW18": {"title": "MCS-RF: mobile crowdsensing-based air quality estimation with random forest.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1550147718804702", "year": "2018", "author": {"Cheng Feng 0006": "76/3473-6", "Ye Tian 0008": "32/5495-8", "Xiangyang Gong": "04/8431", "Xirong Que": "27/8431", "Wendong Wang": "80/4406"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/js/LiuLGW18": {"title": "Optimal Attitude Determination from Vector Sensors Using Fast Analytical Singular Value Decomposition.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/6308530", "year": "2018", "author": {"Zhuohua Liu": "133/4787", "Wei Liu": "49/3283", "Xiangyang Gong": "04/8431", "Jin Wu 0002": "18/1539-2"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/js/LiuLGW18a": {"title": "Simplified Attitude Determination Algorithm Using Accelerometer and Magnetometer with Extremely Low Execution Time.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/8787236", "year": "2018", "author": {"Zhuohua Liu": "133/4787", "Wei Liu": "49/3283", "Xiangyang Gong": "04/8431", "Jin Wu 0002": "18/1539-2"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/tbc/GuoGLWQ18": {"title": "An Optimized Hybrid Unicast/Multicast Adaptive Video Streaming Scheme Over MBMS-Enabled Wireless Networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2018.2832444", "year": "2018", "author": {"Jia Guo": "57/4142", "Xiangyang Gong": "04/8431", "Jie Liang 0001": "51/239-1", "Wendong Wang": "80/4406", "Xirong Que": "27/8431"}, "abstract": " Abstract:Mobile multimedia services have been increasingly popular.

This paper addresses this challenge by studying the issue of control traffic protection in SDNs with arbitrary numbers of controllers. Specifically, we propose a control traffic protection scheme that combines both local rerouting and constrained reverse path forwarding protections, through which switches can locally react to failures and redirect the control traffic using standby backup forwarding options.

Then the data-plane is sliced as multiple virtual networks with the dynamic resource allocation capabilities, in order to carry different services or applications.
