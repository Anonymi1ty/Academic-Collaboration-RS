Existing multi-passage MRC approaches have shown that employing passages with and without golden answers (i.e. labeled and unlabeled passages) for model training can improve prediction accuracy. In this paper, we present MG-MRC, a novel approach for multi-passage MRC via multi-task learning with generative adversarial training. MG-MRC adopts the extract-then-select framework, where an extractor is first used to predict answer candidates, then a selector is used to choose the final answer. In MG-MRC, we adopt multi-task learning to train the extractor by using both labeled and unlabeled passages. In particular, we use labeled passages to train the extractor by supervised learning, while using unlabeled passages to train the extractor by generative adversarial training, where the extractor is regarded as the generator and a discriminator is introduced to evaluate the generated answer candidates. Moreover, to train the extractor by backpropagation in the generative adversarial training process, we propose a hybrid method which combines boundary-based and content-based extracting methods to produce the answer candidate set and its representation.

Knowledge graph embedding has been an active research area for knowledge graph completion, with great improvement from the early TransE to the current state-of-the-art ConvKB. ConvKB considers a knowledge graph as a set of triples, and employs a convolutional neural network to capture global relationships and transitional characteristics between entities and relations in the knowledge graph. However, it only utilizes the triple information, and ignores the rich information contained in relation paths. In fact, a path of one relation describes the relation from some aspect in a fine-grained way. Therefore, it is beneficial to take relation paths into consideration for knowledge graph embedding. In this paper, we present a novel convolutional neural network-based embedding model PConvKB, which improves knowledge graph embedding by incorporating relation paths locally and globally. Specifically, we introduce attention mechanism to measure the local importance of relation paths. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective measure DIPF to compute the global importance of relation paths.

We formulate this prediction problem as the estimation of unobserved entries of the constructed user-event social influence matrix, where each entry represents the influence value of a user on an event. In particular, we define a userâ€™s social influence on a given event as the proportion of the userâ€™s friends who are influenced by him/her to attend the event. To solve this problem, we present a combined collaborative filtering model, namely, Matrix Factorization with Event Neighborhood (MF-EN) model, by incorporating event-based neighborhood method into matrix factorization. Due to the fact that the constructed social influence matrix is very sparse and the overlap values in the matrix are few, it is challenging to find reliable similar event neighbors using the widely adopted similarity measures (e.g., Pearson correlation and Cosine similarity). To address this challenge, we propose an additional information based neighborhood discovery (AID) method by considering three event-specific features in EBSNs. The parameters of our MF-EN model are determined by minimizing the associated regularized squared error function through stochastic gradient descent.

To bridge this gap, we formulate an electricity cost model and design an efficient cost-aware virtual network embedding algorithm by exploiting the location-varying and time-varying diversities of the electricity price and optimizing the energy consumption.

These knowledge bases link real-world entities by their relationships on a large scale, serving as good resources to answer factoid questions. To answer a natural language question using a knowledge base, the main task is mapping it to a structured query of the same meaning, whose results from the knowledge base will be used as the questionâ€™s answers. This mapping task is non-trivial since different questions can express a same meaning and many queries can arise from a knowledge base. To fulfill the task, an important thing is to model a queryâ€™s structure as it conveys a part of the meaning and affects word orders in the question. However, state-of-the-art methods based on deep learning have neglected query structures and focused only on capturing semantic correlations between a question and a simple relation chain. In this paper, we instead take a query as a tree, and encode the orders of entities and relations into its representations to better distinguish candidate queries of a given question. Overall, we first construct candidate queries of a given question from its linked entities, types and number operations. Then, we adopt an encoder-decoder framework which encodes a candidate query and decodes it into the given question, where the decoding probability is used to select the best query from candidates. During encoding, we propose a tree-based LSTM to properly model contexts of an entity or relation in a query, and one such tree-based LSTM runs from all leafs to the root while another runs reversely.

In practice, most images are with multiple category-aware objects, i.e., multi-label images. This paper focuses on hash code learning for multi-label image retrieval. Most existing hashing methods directly extract one patch such as a downsized crop from each image as a training example, which ignores the multi-label characteristic of images and leads to suboptimal representations for multi-label images. Some researches have proved that each multi-label image follows a multi-instance assumption, where each image is represented as a bag of category-aware proposals (instances). However, existing multiple-instance learning methods use predefined statistical functions with limited learning capability to construct bag features, and they are designed for classification or pairwise-similarity preserving. Thus, directly applying existing multiple-instance learning methods into deep hashing framework still leads to suboptimal hash codes for retrieval. In this paper, we pose hashing learning for multi-label image retrieval as a problem of multiple-instance ranking learning. To solve this problem, we present an end-to-end deep hashing framework, referred to as Deep Multiple-Instance Ranking based Hashing (DMIRH). In DMIRH, we design a category-aware bag feature construction module, which jointly assigns the learned instances into categories and aggregates the selected instance features into a bag feature representation that can capture the multi-label information of each image.

None of the\nexisting approaches satisfactorily deals with all three challenges. Overcoming\nthese three challenges, we first propose an approach called Two-Dimensional\nGrids (TDG). Its main idea is to carefully use binning to partition the\ntwo-dimensional (2-D) domains of all attribute pairs into 2-D grids that can\nanswer all 2-D range queries and then estimate the answer of a higher\ndimensional range query from the answers of the associated 2-D range queries.\nHowever, in order to reduce errors due to noises, coarse granularities are\nneeded for each attribute in 2-D grids, losing fine-grained distribution\ninformation for individual attributes. To correct this deficiency, we further\npropose Hybrid-Dimensional Grids (HDG), which also introduces 1-D grids to\ncapture finer-grained information on distribution of each individual attribute\nand combines information from 1-D and 2-D grids to answer range queries. To\nmake HDG consistently effective, we provide a guideline for properly choosing\ngranularities of grids based on an analysis of how different sources of errors\nare impacted by these choices.

In MLQR, realizing that questions are relatively short and usually attached with tags, we first propose a tagword topic model (TTM) to derive topical representations of questions. Based on TTM, we then develop features for each question-user pair, which are captured at both platform level and thread level. In particular, the platform-level features summarize the information of a user from his/her history posts in the CQA platform, while the thread-level features model the pairwise competitions of a user with others in his/her answered threads. Finally, we extend a state-of-the-art learning-to-rank algorithm for training a multi-objective ranking model. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that our MLQR can outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of both answering possibility and answer quality."}, "journals/scn/YanCWSZ16": {"title": "Authentication of spatio-textual similarity join queries in untrusted cloud environments.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/sec.1714", "year": "2016", "author": {"Han Yan": "63/49", "Xiang Cheng 0003": "29/1059-3", "Dezheng Wang": "198/7365", "Sen Su": "63/2499", "Qiying Zhang": "193/6719"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/tkde/XuCSX016": {"title": "Differentially Private Frequent Sequence Mining.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/TKDE.2016.2601106", "year": "2016", "author": {"Shengzhi Xu": "161/7873", "Xiang Cheng 0003": "29/1059-3", "Sen Su": "63/2499", "Ke Xiao": "69/3751", "Li Xiong 0001": "39/3530-1"}, "abstract": " Abstract:In this paper, we study the problem of mining frequent sequences under the rigorous differential privacy model. We explore the possibility of designing a differentially private frequent sequence mining (FSM) algorithm which can achieve both high data utility and a high degree of privacy. We found, in differentially private FSM, the amount of required noise is proportionate to the number of candidate sequences. If we could effectively prune those unpromising candidate sequences, the utility and privacy tradeoff can be significantly improved. To this end, by leveraging a sampling-based candidate pruning technique, we propose \nPFS\n 2^2\n, a novel differentially private FSM algorithm. It is the first algorithm that supports the general gap-constrained FSM in the context of differential privacy. The gap constraints in FSM can be used to limit the mining results to a controlled set of frequent sequences. In our \nPFS\n2^2 \n algorithm, the core is to utilize sample databases to prune the candidate sequences generated based on the downward closure property. In particular, we use the noisy local support of candidate sequences in the sample databases to estimate which candidate sequences are potentially frequent. To improve the accuracy of such private estimations, a gap-aware sequence shrinking method is proposed to enforce the length constraint on the sample databases. Moreover, to calibrate the amount of noise required by differential privacy, a gap-aware sensitivity computation method is proposed to obtain the sensitivity of the local support computations with different gap constraints. Furthermore, to decrease the probability of misestimating frequent sequences as infrequent, a threshold relaxation method is proposed to relax the user-specified threshold for the sample databases.

However, such approach might cause too much information loss and result in poor performance. To limit the cardinality of transactions while reducing the information loss, we argue that long transactions should be split rather than truncated. To this end, we propose a transaction splitting based differentially private FIM algorithm, which is referred to as DP-Apriori.

Specifically, in the pre-processing phase, we first extract some statistical information from the input database, and use the extracted information to determine the values of some variables which will be used in the ESM phase.

However, co-clustering algorithms often require significant computational resources and have been dismissed as impractical for large data sets. Existing studies have provided strong empirical evidence that expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms (e.g., k-means algorithm) with sequential updates can significantly reduce the computational cost without degrading the resulting solution. Motivated by this observation, we introduce sequential updates for alternate minimization co-clustering (AMCC) algorithms which are variants of EM algorithms, and also show that AMCC algorithms with sequential updates converge. We then propose two approaches to parallelize AMCC algorithms with sequential updates in a distributed environment. Both approaches are proved to maintain the convergence properties of AMCC algorithms. Based on these two approaches, we present a new distributed framework, Co-ClusterD, which supports efficient implementations of AMCC algorithms with sequential updates. We design and implement Co-ClusterD, and show its efficiency through two AMCC algorithms: fast nonnegative matrix tri-factorization (FNMTF) and information theoretic co-clustering (ITCC). We evaluate our framework on both a local cluster of machines and the Amazon EC2 cloud.

As energy cost is more than half of the operating cost of the substrate networks, while trying to accommodate more virtual network requests, minimizing energy cost is critical for infrastructure providers.
