By the advantage of this resolution doubling technology, the feature size of mask type RP systems can be increased remarkably. The implementation of this technology is based on a laboratory build micro-RP system. This study includes optical design, mask generation for a set of scatter images, motion control, and resin spray coating. The optical system is transferring the reflecting image of continuing pixels from digital mirror device (DMD) chip onto scatter pixels and projecting on the resin surface. Mask generation software is designed to convert a mask image to a set of scatter images. The resin spray coating is used to add new layer material on the surface of the resin tank for ongoing parts build. As the results, high definition RP parts have been build."}}}
