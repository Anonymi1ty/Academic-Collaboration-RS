The main principle of TAAN is to derive flexible activation functions for different tasks from the data with other parameters of the network fully shared.

Instead, a subset of paths or time intervals of the network can be measured while inferring the remaining network data by leveraging their spatiotemporal correlations.

Tensor completion has attracted some recent attentions with its capability of exploiting the multi-dimensional data structure for more accurate missing data inference. However, current tensor completion algorithms only model the three-order interaction of data features through the inner product, which is insufficient to capture the high-order, nonlinear correlations across different feature dimensions. In this paper, we propose a novel Neural Tensor Completion (NTC) scheme to effectively model three-order interaction among data features with the outer product and build a 3D interaction map. Based on which, we apply 3D convolution to learn features of high-order interaction from the local range to the global range. We demonstrate this will lead to good learning ability. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world network monitoring datasets, Abilene and WS-DREAM, to demonstrate that NTC can significantly reduce the error in missing data recovery.

Some existing approaches solve the problem through sequential models or learning pair-wise distances between items.

To better define the fashion compatibility and more flexibly meet different needs, we propose a novel problem of learning compatibility among multiple tuples (each consisting of an item and category pair), and recommending fashion items following the category choices from customers.

However, the irregularity of memory access caused by the sparsity severely damages the regularity of intensive computation loops. Therefore, the architecture design for sparse neural networks is crucial to better software and hardware co-design for neural network applications.

When there is a need to translate images across n domains, if the training is performed between every two domains, the complexity of the training will increase quadratically. Moreover, training with data from two domains only at a time cannot benefit from data of other domains, which prevents the extraction of more useful features and hinders the progress of this research area.

The vehicular network experiences intermittent connectivity as a result of the mobility, which makes the inter-vehicle contact duration a scarce resource for data transmissions and the support of monitoring applications over vehicular networks a challenge. We propose a novel compressive sensing (CS)-based scheme to enable efficient decentralized context sharing in vehicular delay tolerant networks, called CS-Sharing. To greatly reduce the data transmission overhead and speed up the monitoring processing, CS-sharing exploits two techniques: sending an aggregate message in each vehicle encounter, and quick collection of information taking advantage of data sharing and the sparsity of events in vehicle networks to significantly reduce the number of measurements needed for global information recovery. We propose a novel data structure, and an aggregation method that can take advantage of the random and opportunistic vehicle encounters to form the measurement matrix. We prove that the measurement matrix satisfies the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) property required by the CS technique. Our results from extensive simulations demonstrate that CS-Sharing allows vehicles in a large network to quickly obtain the full context data with the successful recovery ratio larger than 90%."}, "conf/iwqos/Xie0LM16": {"title": "Exploiting time-varying graphs for data forwarding in mobile social Delay-Tolerant Networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/IWQoS.2016.7590436", "year": "2016", "author": {"Dongliang Xie": "27/3906", "Xin Wang 0001": "10/5630-1", "Lanchao Liu": "16/8970", "Linhui Ma": "187/7010"}, "abstract": " Abstract:With the rapid shift from end-to-end communications to content-based data sharing, there are increasing interests in exploiting mobile social Delay-Tolerant Networks (social DTNs) to deliver data, where the forwarding decision is usually made by comparing the social metrics of encountered nodes.

Most of the approaches targeted to WSNs with mobile sinks (MSs) addressed the problem of data delivery where only a few messages are reported during a long time frame. However, transmitting streaming data is becoming relevant in WSNs, as more and more multimedia sensor nodes - equipped with image, audio, and video capabilities - are being used to characterize the sensing environment. In this scenario, a sequence of messages propagates into the network, hence the problem of finding an effective routing path for delivering data to MSs becomes even more challenging, since the communication overhead for reaching the MS might also be significant. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient streaming data delivery (SDD) protocol for cluster-based WSNs with MSs. Different from existing works, we focus on the mobility support for the delivery of streaming data in hierarchical WSNs. By introducing a cross-cluster handover mechanism and a path redirection scheme, SDD maintains the end-to-end connectivity between the source and the MS, while avoiding the constant transmission of the MS location as it moves across multiple clusters. We evaluate the performance of the proposed SDD protocol, and compare it with a hierarchical cluster-based data dissemination protocol.

Although the existing separation algorithm based on Direct Robust Matrix Factorization (DRMF) is proven to be effective, requiring iteratively performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for low-rank matrix approximation would result in a prohibitively high accumulated computation cost when the data matrix is large.

In this paper, we design MPTMG, a Multi-dimensional Pricing mechanism based on Two-sided Market Game. We propose three types of prices: a multi-dimensional price corresponding to multi-dimensional resource allocation, a penalty price to encourage fair and high quality cloud services, and a benefit discount factor to motivate more even provisioning of resources on different dimensions in the cloud. Based on these prices, we propose a distributed price-adjustment algorithm for efficient resource allocation and QoS-aware offloading scheduling. We prove that the algorithm can converge in a finite number of iterations to the equilibrium core allocation at which the mobile cloud system achieves the Pareto efficiency by maximizing the total system benefit.
