The switch of the radiator was controlled by the input voice into the microphone. A voice recognition module connected with Arduino microcontroller which assigned the switches to turn on or off by the instructions of the user's voice. The results presented that the little sun works. In 82 tests, 80 voice commands was successfully recognized at the first command, and 2 voice commands was successfully recognized after repeating the first commands in the condition of signal-to-voice ratios (SNR) in the range of 10 to 30 dB. Therefore, a low cost, easy to use and high performance voice controlled radiator was implemented to improve the convenience and comfortability of human life."}}}
