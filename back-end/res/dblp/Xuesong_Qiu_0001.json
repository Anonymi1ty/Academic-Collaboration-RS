In view of the problem of resource utilization efficiency and fault recovery capability in the network, and in order to meet the QoS requirements of different services, this paper proposes the network resource allocation and reliability guarantee mechanism of mobile core network. The Real-time resource-aware balanced allocation algorithm (RRBA) performs real-time monitoring on the utilization status of the substrate network resources, and preferentially allocates the services to the physical paths with more available resources, so as to achieve the balance of the network load as much as possible.

Cell Outage Detection (COD) which is the essential functionality in Self-Organizing Network (SON) is designed to autonomously deal with unexpected faults. Typical methods for detecting cell outage are usually based on Manual Drive Tests (MDT). However, it is difficult to detect small cell outage by MDT measurements in HetNets, because the User Equipment (UE) served by these small cells can switch to the macro cell and keep the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) values normal. To resolve this issue, we propose a COD architecture based on the handover statistics. Our model concentrates on cell outage detection in a two-tier heterogeneous network. We process sequential handover statistics spatially and temporally in conjunction with data mining methods. Also, an improved LOF algorithm (M-LOF) is proposed to enhance the detection performance based on handover statistics. To evaluate the system performance, a set of tests has been carried out using some reasonable assumptions and network simulator we designed.

However, some additional fault detection tasks will make so busy the manager node to be failed more quickly. Moreover, at the first beginning period most sensor networks are working normally without any dead nodes and the probing work are actually ineffective. Thus it is important to study the problems of electing the probe stations and probing frequency.

Secondly, the scheduling strategy based on the maximum coverage of active pest periods with the minimum number of working SILs (MaxCAP-MinNWS) is proposed to address the turning \non\n and \noff\n scheduling of SILs, while considering the joint optimization of energy consumption and insecticidal efficiency. Simulation results show that compared with the existing preset working period scheduling and unified scheduling strategies, the proposed strategy can improve utilization of energy resources in insecticidal by up to 20%. In addition, the energy supply and consumption of SILs can be more balanced, and the battery deep discharging of SILs can be relieved."}, "journals/tbc/QiLLYQ22": {"title": "Enhanced 5G Mobile Broadcasting Service With Shape-Adaptive RIS.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/TBC.2022.3152053", "year": "2022", "author": {"Fei Qi 0002": "59/985-2", "Qiang Liu 0030": "61/3234-30", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": " Abstract:There emerges a strong trend recently to create an intelligent and controllable wireless transmission environment by installing reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) on the surface of diverse.

The state information is always extremely complicated in edge computing environment. Different container service combinations reach edge computing nodes at different time periods.

Another problem is that resource shortages or hardware failures of these edge networks can affect the service migration policy. In this paper, a novel service migration method based on state adaptation and deep reinforcement learning is proposed to efficiently overcome network failures. Before migration, we define four edge network states to discuss the migration policy and adopt the two-dimensional movement around the edge servers to adapt to the applications scenarios of our work.

Next, to achieve efficient resource aggregation of ESs, a user-behavior-aware dynamic collaborative caching domain (DCCD) construction and management mechanism is devised to divide ESs into clusters, select cluster heads, and set the re-clustering rules. Then a DRL-based content caching and delivery algorithm is presented to decide the caching content of ESs in a DCCD from a global perspective and plan the transmission path for users, which reduces redundant content and transmission delay.

As a promising networking technology, Software-defined networking (SDN) is applied to the communication architecture construction of SPCN due to the benefits of a global view of the SDN controller along with the programmability. At the same time, in light of the significance of control services to EI and to ensure continuous and reliable transmission, dual routes are urgent to be preplanned so that the SDN controller freely switch control services from the primary routes to the alternate routes in the case of failures. However, the existing constructed routing strategies confront the conflict of network risk concentration as well as the requirement of service latency. Moreover, there are few studies considering both network operation risk and the latency requirement during routes planning. Hence, the problem of simultaneously minimizing the effect of network risk and potential delay of routes is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, which is NP-hard. We propose a novel risk-aware routes planning mechanism (RSRM) based on an evolutional algorithm. Extensive emulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach shows a better performance in different network topologies. At the same time, the metric of balancing risk of the network with RSRM achieves the minimum in comparison with other schemes while guarantees the near minimal service latency."}, "journals/access/YangDQG20": {"title": "FGGAN: Feature-Guiding Generative Adversarial Networks for Text Generation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2993928", "year": "2020", "author": {"Yang Yang 0006": "48/450-6", "Xiaodong Dan": "268/1087", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342", "Zhipeng Gao": "25/2165"}, "abstract": " Abstract:Text generation is a basic work of natural language processing, which plays an important role in dialogue system and intelligent translation.

This paper proposes a text generation model named Feature-Guiding Generative Adversarial Networks (FGGAN). To solve the problem of insufficient feedback guidance from the discriminator network, FGGAN uses a feature guidance module to extract text features from the discriminator network, convert them into feature guidance vectors and feed them into the generator network for guidance. In addition, sampling is required to complete the sequence before feeding it into the discriminator to get feedback signal in text generation. However, the randomness and insufficiency of the sampling method lead to poor quality of generated text.

Nowadays the network scale and the magnitude of flows increase greatly, which leads to the need to deploy a large number of flow entries in face of failures.

Then a dynamic embedding mechanism based on load balancing is presented to increase the acceptance rate of VNRs. Second, when embedding is saturated, an embedding update mechanism is proposed to deal with the arrival of new VNRs. It promotes the acceptance rate of high-priority VNRs and the revenue of the infrastructure provider (InP).

Inspired by information-centric networking (ICN), content-centric VANETs have emerged as a promising architecture to address the challenges of traditional IP-based communications in VANETs. However, several issues need to be solved with regard to this architecture. Among them, inflexible routing schemata based on IP addresses, inefficient traffic caused by network broadcast, and volatility in the network environment cause low network performance in VANETs. By focusing on the content routing of the VANETs, we propose a multiple unicast path-forwarding scheme, MUPF, in which we aim to build multiple stable unicast forwarding paths in content-centric VANETs. The main design concepts of MUPF are as follows: (1) By introducing the idea of ICN, we avoid using the fixed-communication “host-to-host” method employed in IP; MUPF applies a content-centric routing process to request for and reply to packets. (2) We have evaluated the often-occurring broadcast in VANETs, which is thought to have a bad impact on network performance; hence, MUPF uses multiple unicast forwarding paths to deliver the packets instead of a simple broadcast. (3) Considering the highly volatile feature of VANETs, wherein the links are easily broken when the nodes leave, combined with the nodes’ motion parameters and link quality metrics, MUPF can choose some more reliable nodes as next hops to improve the time tolerance of each routing path. In terms of average response time, the performance improvement achieved by MUPF is ∼10%, 15–20%, and 60% compared to CCVN, V-NDN, and TCP/IP, respectively.

The simulation results show that the GRSS and PRSS methods can achieve better coverage and utilize less distance compared with the random algorithm and 3-D self-deployment."}, "journals/access/ZhaoFYLQ17": {"title": "A Social-Aware Resource Allocation for 5G Device-to-Device Multicast Communication.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2731805", "year": "2017", "author": {"Pan Zhao 0002": "61/3903-2", "Lei Feng 0001": "76/847-1", "Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": " Abstract:With the ever-increasing demands for popular content sharing among humans, device-to-device (D2D) multicast communication, as a promising technology to support wireless services within a local area, is introduced in a 5G cellular network. However, the existing resource allocation approaches for D2D multicast communication usually consider only physical domain constraints but neglect social domain factors, which would result in ineffective D2D links between users unwilling to share interests. Different from existing works, the D2D multicast scheme proposed in this paper will produce effective D2D multicast links by sufficiently utilizing both the physical and social properties of mobile users, with the goal to maximize the throughput of the overall social-aware network and guarantee fairly allocation of the channel between different D2D multicast clusters. The scheme mainly consists of two parts, the formation of D2D multicast clusters and joint optimization of power and channel allocation. In the formation of D2D multicast clusters, members and head in each cluster are selected by taking into account both social attributes and physical factors, such as community, ties, and geographical closeness. In the joint optimization, a two-step scheme is designed to first calculate the optimal power allocation by geometric proximity and then select suitable cellular channels for each D2D multicast cluster utilizing an extended one-to-many bipartite graphs matching algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with heuristic algorithm and stochastic algorithm, the proposed scheme can increase the throughput of the overall social-aware network by about 5% and 50%, respectively."}, "journals/access/YinLFYQ17": {"title": "Multi-Cell Cooperative Outage Compensation in Cloud-RANs Based 5G Public Safety Network.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2734925", "year": "2017", "author": {"Mengjun Yin": "152/1083", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Lei Feng 0001": "76/847-1", "Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": "Topic: Mission Critical Public-Safety Communications: Architectures, Enabling Technologies, and Future Applications"}, "journals/chinaf/HuangRZNQ17": {"title": "General, practical, and accurate models for the performance analysis of cache cascades.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11432-016-0178-2", "year": "2017", "author": {"Haoqiu Huang": "168/7949", "Lanlan Rui": "03/4227", "Weiwei Zheng": "176/0935", "Danmei Niu": "68/10365", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": "为了分析缓存级联的性能, 本文提出了一种通用的、实用的、精确的模型。首先, 通过扩展Melazzi近似, 模型分析了LCE, LCP, LCD等实用的复制策略下缓存级联的性能。其次, 通过建模缓存驱逐时间, 模型捕获了邻居缓存间的状态关联, 使其能够充分地反映缓存的真实状态。最后, 不局限于传统的独立参考模型, 模型刻画了请求流量的时间局部性。仿真实验结果表明模型能够在较低的计算开销下提供精确的性能分析结果。"}, "journals/ejwcn/RuiGSHQ17": {"title": "ICN routing selecting scheme based on link quality for the urban vehicles' communication.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s13638-017-0991-3", "year": "2017", "author": {"Lanlan Rui": "03/4227", "Hui Guo": "70/2221", "Ruichang Shi": "189/8247", "Haoqiu Huang": "168/7949", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/ijdsn/YangJYQL17": {"title": "Reputation detection based on incomplete ", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/1550147717715558", "year": "2017", "author": {"Yang Yang 0006": "48/450-6", "Xiaoyu Jin": "37/6331", "Su Yao": "198/8323", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342", "Liu Liu": "74/7037"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/mta/NiuRHQ17": {"title": "A service recovery method based on trust evaluation in mobile social network.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-016-3963-4", "year": "2017", "author": {"Danmei Niu": "68/10365", "Lanlan Rui": "03/4227", "Haoqiu Huang": "168/7949", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": "Mobile social network makes users create and share multimedia contents freely and conveniently.

Like other network tomography problems, it requires solving a system of equations that involve measurement values and the loss rates of links. However, the equations do not have a unique solution in general. One kind of method imposes unrealistic assumption on the system, e.g. the uniform prior probability of a link being congested. Other methods use multiple probe measurements to acquire more information about the system that may generate many additional overhead costs. In this paper, we demonstrate that a considerable portion (more than 95 %) of links could be uniquely identified by current measurements directly. Then we utilize the information of these determined links to acquire the global distribution of the system that can help to infer the rest loss rates. Moreover, we derive an upper bound on the accuracy of a congestion localization problem using the Bayesian network that provides a necessary condition for achieving the 0—error diagnosis. Finally, we evaluate our new method and a former representative method by both the simulation and the real implementation in the PlanetLab network. The results show that our method not only makes a great improvement on the accuracy, but also reduces the probe costs and the running time to an extremely low level. Furthermore, our method can also perform well in large and more congested networks."}, "journals/ijdsn/YuLQ12": {"title": "Self-Organizing Energy-Saving Management Mechanism Based on Pilot Power Adjustment in Cellular Networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/721957", "year": "2012", "author": {"Peng Yu 0001": "50/2599-1", "Wenjing Li 0001": "08/6548-1", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/ahswn/YangQMC11": {"title": "Negotiation-based Stimulating Cooperation of Selfish nodes in the Ad hoc Networks.", "url": "http://www.oldcitypublishing.com/journals/ahswn-home/ahswn-issue-contents/ahswn-volume-13-number-3-4-2011/ahswn-13-3-4-p-227-249/", "year": "2011", "author": {"Yang Yang 0006": "48/450-6", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342", "Luoming Meng": "52/382", "Lin Chen": "13/3479"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/sensors/HuangQR11": {"title": "Simple Random Sampling-Based Probe Station Selection for Fault Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3390/s110303117", "year": "2011", "author": {"Rimao Huang": "57/10696", "Xuesong Qiu 0001": "13/342", "Lanlan Rui": "03/4227"}, "abstract": ""}}}
