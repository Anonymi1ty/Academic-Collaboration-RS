Each agent is a switched linear system. We propose an agent-dependent multiple Lyapunov function (MLF) approach to design the switching law for each switched agent. The distributed controller for each agent is constructed based on a dynamic compensator. A sufficient condition for the solvability of the output regulation problem of switched agent networks is presented by distributed controllers and agent-dependent multiple Lyapunov function approach. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our theory."}, "journals/ijsysc/WuHZJ18": {"title": "Adaptive Hâˆž fault-tolerant control for a class of uncertain switched nonlinear systems with multiple state time delays.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/00207721.2018.1479004", "year": "2018", "author": {"Li-Bing Wu": "157/1049", "Xi-Qin He": "41/9463", "Da-Qing Zhang 0001": "215/5891-1", "Hong-Wei Jia": "225/2855"}, "abstract": ""}}}
