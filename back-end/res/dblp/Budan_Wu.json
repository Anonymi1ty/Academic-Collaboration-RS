To solve this problem, a relation mining method is proposed for obtaining activity dependence relations. The formal description of these relations is defined in control flow perspective, which is expressed as serial-dependence relations and parallel-dependence relations in the form of three tuples after analyzing all the control flow patterns. And a mining algorithm is proposed for mining these two types of relations based on the process model. The correctness and performance of this algorithm are verified by a large number of experiments, and the experimental results show this method can quickly and accurately extract all the activity dependence relations from the existing process models in a business domain."}, "conf/chinacom/ZhouLFZW17": {"title": "A SDN Security Transmission Service Using Multi-connection and Time-Slot Scheduling.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-78130-3_47", "year": "2017", "author": {"Shiqi Zhou": "46/1657", "Rongheng Lin": "35/3624", "Shuquan Fan": "223/2172", "Hua Zou": "66/3384", "Budan Wu": "80/6229"}, "abstract": "SDN (Software-Defined Networking) provides a new approach to improve network security.

In many large-scale distributed mission critical areas, publish/subscribe systems must support a large number of geographically distributed publishers and subscribers and ensure real-time event data to be delivered timely. The concern is that a large number of low priority events may clog the channel thereby causing high priority events to get delayed. The challenge raised for the event-based middleware in large-scale distributed system is that event priority determination engine must be efficient and scalable in term of priority rule size and event throughputs. Checking every rule for priority on-the-fly is not friendly to the cache. This paper proposed an innovative approach based on Bloom filter technique. This approach is cache friendly and the online computation time of event priority determination is independent of the rule size. This approach is based on two ideas: make the online queries as simple as possible and exploit the power of cache on the broker. The rule instantiation engine (RIE) is made offline while online part is the priority determination engine (PDE). A Bloom filter data structure is used by RIE to store the rule instances and their priorities. The complex rule evaluation is reduced to set membership testing as queries on Bloom filters. The PDE makes the querying simplified by event discretization. Results are then cached in the broker caches. Finally, we have an analysis on the system complexity and some open issues.

Generally, the daily load curves are clustered first in order to obtain load patterns of each consumer. However, due to the volume and high dimensions of load curves, existing clustering algorithms are not appropriate in this situation. Thus, a fused load curve clustering algorithm based on wavelet transform (FCCWT) is proposed to solve this problem. The algorithm includes two main phases. First, FCCWT applies multilevel discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to convert the daily load curves for dimensionality reduction. Second, it detects clusters at two outputs of the first phase, and then fuses two groups of clusters with a sub-algorithm named cluster fusion to achieve the optimized clusters. FCCWT is implemented on datasets of both China and United States. Their clustering performances are evaluated by diverse validity indices comparing with four typical clustering methods. The experimental results show that FCCWT outperforms other comparison methods.

In this feedback control system, process mining plays an important role in generating feedback of process execution for redesign. However, the existing discovery methods cannot mine certain special structures from execution logs (e.g., implicit dependency, implicit place and short loops) correctly and their mining efficiencies cannot meet the requirements of online process mining.

However, the burst loss in the unreliable wireless channels is a severely challenging problem which significantly degrades the effectiveness of bandwidth aggregation. Previous studies mainly address the critical problem by reactively increasing the forward error correction (FEC) redundancy. In this paper, we propose a loss tolerant bandwidth aggregation approach (LTBA), which proactively leverages the channel diversity in heterogeneous wireless networks to overcome the burst loss. First, we allocate the FEC packets according to the ‘loss-free’ bandwidth of each wireless network to the multihomed client. Second, we deliberately insert intervals between the FEC packets’ departures while still respecting the delay constraint. The proposed LTBA is able to reduce the consecutive packet loss under burst loss assumption. We carry out analysis to prove that the proposed LTBA outperforms the existing ‘back-to-back’ transmission schemes based on Gilbert loss model and continuous time Markov chain. We conduct the performance evaluation in Exata and emulation results show that LTBA outperforms the existing approaches in improving the video quality in terms of PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)."}, "journals/spe/TsaiWJ0L13": {"title": "Ontology patterns for service-oriented software development.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/spe.1132", "year": "2013", "author": {"Wei-Tek Tsai": "87/3960", "Budan Wu": "80/6229", "Zhi Jin": "22/3510", "Yu Huang 0008": "39/6301-8", "Wu Li": "84/3238"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/jsw/YangWCG11": {"title": "Maximum Portfolio: A Query Condition Optimization Method.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.4304/jsw.6.12.2486-2494", "year": "2011", "author": {"Zhi Yang": "90/5587", "Budan Wu": "80/6229", "Junliang Chen": "63/6051", "Pingli Gu": "15/8405"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/jwsr/WangJLW10": {"title": "Specifying and Composing Web Services with an Environment Ontology-Based Approach.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.4018/jwsr.2010070104", "year": "2010", "author": {"Puwei Wang": "27/3001", "Zhi Jin": "22/3510", "Lin Liu 0001": "61/2115-1", "Budan Wu": "80/6229"}, "abstract": ""}, "journals/chinaf/HouJW06": {"title": "Modeling and verifying Web services driven by requirements: An ontology-based approach.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11432-006-2031-5", "year": "2006", "author": {"Lishan Hou": "77/1769", "Zhi Jin": "22/3510", "Budan Wu": "80/6229"}, "abstract": "Automatic discovery and composition of Web services is an important research area in Web service technology, in which the specification of Web services is a key issue.
