The existing approaches are implemented in diverse deep learning frameworks and settings, making it difficult to reproduce the results published by the original authors. Undoubtedly, this phenomenon is detrimental to the development of Video Anomaly detection and community communication. In this paper, we present a PyTorch-based video anomaly detection toolbox, namely PyAnomaly that contains high modular and extensible components, comprehensive and impartial evaluation platforms, a friendly manageable system configuration, and the abundant engineering deployment functions. To make it easy-to-use and easy-to-extend, we implement the architecture by hooks and registers functionality. Remarkably, we have reproduced the comparable experimental results of six representative methods as those published by the original authors, and we will release these pre-trained models with more rich configurations. To our best knowledge, the PyAnomaly is the first open-source tool in video anomaly detection and is available at https://github.com/YuhaoCheng/PyAnomaly.\n\t"}, "conf/acmturc/SongDLM19": {"title": "CNDTSN: enhanced DTSN based on classified nodes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1145/3321408.3321598", "year": "2019", "author": {"Yecheng Song": "245/1398", "Pengrui Duan": "09/10696", "Liang Liu 0001": "10/6178-1", "Huadong Ma": "04/6217"}, "abstract": "\n\t\tIn the time of Internet of Things, with the explosion of scalar data in wireless sensor network(WSN), single type of scalar data transmission can no longer fulfill the needs in various WSN situations. Due to the limitation of available resources on WSN devices, several transmit protocols are designed to effectively improve the channel utilization efficiency and reduce the end-to-end delay. When transmitting non-scalar data like pictures presented as arrays or matrixs, traditional protocol can barely handle this situation efficiently. In this paper, we propose CNDTSN, nodes in WSN are classified into two types, R nodes with strong storage capacity and s nodes mainly collecting the information.

To cope with the dynamic nature of the LEO networks, a flexible management architecture that can provide low-latency configuration and routing services is desired. Recent advances of Software Defined Networks (SDN) inspire researches using geostationary satellites, GEO, as the controllers to build the SDN solutions for LEO satellite networks. However, GEO-based solutions inevitably face the bottleneck problem because all the routing requests have to be processed and forwarded by a limited number of GEO satellites. In this paper, we propose HTCA, a Hierarchical Terrestrial Controllers Architecture based on SDN that reuses the ground stations instead of dedicated GEO satellites to establish a more scalable control plane. But the limited coverage of a ground station brings about design challenges for consistent network management and seamless routing service. HTCA adopts an online network view integration method to support flexible and consistent management. A load-aware routing method is also designed for HTCA to provide seamless and low-latency routing service. The experiment results demonstrate that HTCA can achieve agile configuration and reduce the instruction update time by 86.87%, compared with the GEO-based solution."}, "conf/msn/LiD19": {"title": "AMRnet: A Real-Time Automatic Modulation Recognition Network for Wireless Communication System.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1109/MSN48538.2019.00031", "year": "2019", "author": {"Xinyu Li": "88/2359", "Pengrui Duan": "09/10696"}, "abstract": " Abstract:In recent years, deep learning has brought new opportunities and challenges to the wireless communication field, owing to its expressive capacity and convenient optimization capability.

Our proposed AMRnet consists of a series of convolutional neural networks based on the design theory of lightweight networks. More specifically, depthwise separable convolution structure is used to reduce computational complexity of the whole network. Residual block is included to improve the robustness for the simple backbone network. In addition, channel attention mechanism is added to lay more emphasis on the channel-wise information due to the unique data futures of the I/Q signal.

In this paper, we first analyze the effect of payload length on the overhead of bit error, video frame reassembly and network efficiency. Then, to improve the quality of video transmission, we propose an adaptive payload length algorithm based on the digital fountain codes while take transmission efficiency into account. The simulation environment is also designed to evaluate the performance of multi-hop video transmission, which is based on the ARM embedded system.

The key of achieving better performance is to well capture the non-linear spatial-temporal dependency. The state-of-the-art works consider both aspects, but they ignore the effect of the global trend on local dynamics and fail to capture long-term dynamic dependencies. In this article, we propose a novel Global-Local Temporal Convolutional Network (GL-TCN) to break through these limitations. Specifically, a novel local temporal convolutional mechanism is proposed to capture the long-term local dynamics effectively. Meanwhile, the global and local flow patterns are integrated to handle the effect of the global flow trend on local dynamics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize the temporal convolutional network for traffic flow prediction.

Most existing studies take a greedy scheme in data forwarding process, i.e., only nodes with higher utility values than current carriers can be selected as relays. They lack an in-depth investigation on the main features of the optimal paths in Epidemic. These features are vital to any forwarding scheme that tends to make a trade-off between packet delivery delay and cost. This is mainly because Epidemic provides an upper bound on cost and a lower bound on delivery delay. Therefore, a deep understanding of these features is useful to make informed forwarding decisions. In this paper, we try to explore these features by observing the roles of different social relationships in the optimal paths through a set of real datasets. These datasets provide evidence that strangers have two sides in data forwarding process, and that the importance of strangers shows a decreasing trend along the forwarding paths. Using this heuristic knowledge, we propose STRON, a distributed and lightweight forwarding scheme. The distributed feature makes it very suitable for opportunistic scenarios and the low communication and computation features make it easy to be integrated with state-of-the-art work. The trace-driven simulations obviously confirm its effectiveness, especially in terms of packet delivery delay and cost.
