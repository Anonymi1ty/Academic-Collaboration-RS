In order to denote users' needs more accurately, this algorithm sets multiple pheromones. The DACO is also improved based on experiment in order to make it better and faster converge to optimization value. Simulation experiment in this paper shows that the DACO is more effective than Ant Colony Algorithm and a Genetic Algorithm applied to services composition."}}}
