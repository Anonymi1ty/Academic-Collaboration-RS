 process to distributed systems, how to properly partition the process is a key issue. If closely related sub-process fragments are assigned into many different servers, the frequent interactions of the sub-processes will result in large server communication costs. However, most of the current works in business process fragmentation focus on optimizing load balancing to achieve high execution performance, without considering the intrinsic functional aggregation of partitioned sub-processes. This paper proposes a novel distributed business process fragmentation method based on community discovery, which aggregates functional related process partitions together to optimize server communication costs during business process execution. An advanced fuzzy models (AFM) and control-data flow model which are more suitable for community discovery are presented. And the community-based process fragmentation algorithm (CPFA) is developed to get an optimized business process distributed deployment schema, reducing communications between servers and data access communication costs. We evaluate our method with BPI dataset, and demonstrate that it significantly reduces communication costs between servers for process execution efficiency while also maintain good server resource load balancing.'}

However, due to the volume and high dimensions of load curves, existing clustering algorithms are not appropriate in this situation. Thus, a fused load curve clustering algorithm based on wavelet transform (FCCWT) is proposed to solve this problem. The algorithm includes two main phases. First, FCCWT applies multilevel discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to convert the daily load curves for dimensionality reduction. Second, it detects clusters at two outputs of the first phase, and then fuses two groups of clusters with a sub-algorithm named cluster fusion to achieve the optimized clusters. FCCWT is implemented on datasets of both China and United States. Their clustering performances are evaluated by diverse validity indices comparing with four typical clustering methods. The experimental results show that FCCWT outperforms other comparison methods. Additionally, case analysis of two datasets are also provided to discuss the significance of load patterns.'}

The Bayesian approach provides a powerful way to structure models for achieving these goals. While no single estimate can be optimal for achieving all three inferential goals, the communication and credibility of results will be enhanced by reporting a single estimate that performs well for all three. Triple goal estimates [Shen and Louis, 1998. Triple-goal estimates in two-stage hierarchical models. J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 60, 455–471] have this performance and are appealing for performance evaluations. Because triple-goal estimates rely more heavily on the entire distribution than do posterior means, they are more sensitive to misspecification of the population distribution and we present various strategies to robustify triple-goal estimates by using nonparametric distributions. We evaluate performance based on the correctness and efficiency of the robustified estimates under several scenarios and compare empirical Bayes and fully Bayesian approaches to model the population distribution. We find that when data are quite informative, conclusions are robust to model misspecification. However, with less information in the data, conclusions can be quite sensitive to the choice of population distribution. Generally, use of a nonparametric distribution pays very little in efficiency when a parametric population distribution is valid, but successfully protects against model misspecification.'}

However, it has relatively lower detection performance on small objects and suffers from slow convergence. This paper observed that DETR performs surprisingly well even on small objects when measuring Average Precision (AP) at decreased Intersection-over-Union (IoU) thresholds. Motivated by this observation, we propose a simple way to improve DETR by refining the coarse features and predicted locations. Specifically, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine (CF) decoder layer constituted of a coarse layer and a carefully designed fine layer. Within each CF decoder layer, the extracted local information (region of interest feature) is introduced into the flow of global context information from the coarse layer to refine and enrich the object query features via the fine layer. In the fine layer, the multi-scale information can be fully explored and exploited via the Adaptive Scale Fusion(ASF) module and Local Cross-Attention (LCA) module. The multi-scale information can also be enhanced by another proposed Transformer Enhanced FPN (TEF) module to further improve the performance. With our proposed framework (named CF-DETR), the localization accuracy of objects (especially for small objects) can be largely improved. As a byproduct, the slow convergence issue of DETR can also be addressed. The effectiveness of CF-DETR is validated via extensive experiments on the coco benchmark. CF-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance among end-to-end detectors, e.g., achieving 47.8 AP using ResNet-50 with 36 epochs in the standard 3x training schedule.\n\t\t\t\t'}

While relevancy has been the prevailing issue of the recommendation problem for the last decades, diversity, which is associated with increasing user satisfaction with the presented recommendation lists and mitigating the overfitting problem, also plays a central role in the success of predictive models. Existing work applied determinantal point processes (DPP) to provide a favorable trade-off between relevance and diversity. However, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference for DPP is generally NP-hard. To attain an approximate solution with sufficient accuracy, popular approximation approaches such as forward and backward greedy algorithms are used. Despite their intuitive manner, they are not adequate and still be too computationally expensive to be used in large-scale domains. Thus, this paper aims to enhance forward greedy algorithms incorporating backward elimination algorithms and accelerate the greedy MAP inference for DPP by introducing the Cholesky decomposition and Givens rotation. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is faster than most competitors and ensures a substantial improvement over the accuracy-diversity trade-off on the Netflix Prize dataset.'}

Therefore, recommending diverse apps is more likely to cover users' all preferences, and even guide users to discover new needs and interests. To this end, we give the definition of Application Diversity that taking into account the similarity between apps and the relevance of categories, and propose a novel application recommendation approach that consists of two parts, P-Stair Neural Network (P-SNN) and Dynamic Adjustment Method (DAM). First, P-SNN learns user preferences from multi-dimensional data by using deep neural networks techniques, and predicts users' ratings for uninstalled applications.

First, it has lower computational complexity. We use Manhattan distance instead of Euclidean distance to measure similarity between fraud samples and ordinaries. Second, new fraud patterns can be detected effectively by joint fraud probability. Finally, UIS is able to generate and update real-time scores, which detects early-time fraud and minimizes economic losses. Integrated experiments on real datasets of the telecom industry demonstrate that UIS is real-time, effective, and robust in different situations."}

Recently, it has became a reality that more accurate model training is achieved through the large-scale deployment of FL on resource-constrained device, where the communication is expensive and clients dropping out is common, such as mobile phone or IoT devices etc. However, shared local gradients make the privacy of local data in FL vulnerable, and the client is easily deceived by the server for the returned forged results. To solve these problems, the existing schemes either only consider the privacy protection requirements under the communication-limited but not involving verifiability, or consider the privacy-protection and verification separately, which incurs expensive computation and communication costs. It is a challenge to design a lightweight verifiable privacy preserving gradient aggregation scheme for large-scale resource-constrained clients under the communication-limited condition. In this paper, we proposed a non-interactive verifiable privacy-preserving FL based on dual-servers (NIVP-DS) architecture, which improves the efficiency and security of the system and is robust to clients dropping out, based on the constraints that the communication overhead between client and server not more than 2× that of plaintext computation. Based on NIVP-DS, an efficient privacy gradient aggregation scheme is presented by exploiting random matrix coding and secure 2-party computation. The scheme only costs O(M) fully linear operation in the client side under the communication constraints. In order to realize the verifiability, a cross-verification method is introduce, which is based on credible matrix exchange to extend the privacy aggregation scheme to a verifiable scheme. The method only costs little additional overhead, meanwhile, guarantees that one dishonest server cannot forge the aggregate results to deceive the honest client, even if it colludes with multiple clients. The effectiveness of NIVP-DS in practice is corroborated by experiments. The results show that the performance of both secure aggregation and verification are efficiency, and the additional overhead of verification is minimal.'}

Second, the existing credit scoring models are generally cannot be updated online. The loan transaction of P2P lending is very frequent and the new data leads data distribution to change. A credit scoring model without considering data update causes a serious deviation or even failure in subsequent credit assessment. In this paper, we propose a new online integrated credit scoring model (OICSM) for P2P Lending.

Offline and online experiments based on real and representative credit datasets are conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that OICSM can significantly improve performance due to its advantage in deep learning over two features, and it can further correct model deterioration due to its online dynamic update capability.'}

The main idea of the LDP is to add randomness in real data to guarantee individual's private sensitive information. Here, the technology of randomized response is an effective method to realize the LDP mechanism. In fact, the randomized response is a probabilistic mapping from the real data to perturbed data, which can be modeled as an information-theoretic lossy compression mechanism. What's more, the privacy budget ϵ has become a de facto standard to quantify the worst-case privacy leakage. However, such a metrics can not capture the question that which one is the optimal privacy mechanism in a set of equivalent ϵ-privacy mechanisms. Besides, the privacy and utility are closely correlated with the privacy mechanism, and existing methods do not consider the strategic adversary's behavior. In this paper, we tackle the problem of tradeoffs privacy and utility under the rational framework within an information-theoretic approach as the metrics. To address the problem, we first formulate this trade-off as a minimax information leakage problem. Then, we propose a privacy preserving attack and defense (PPAD) game framework, that is, a two-person zero-sum (TPZS) game. Further, we develop an alternating optimization algorithm to compute the saddle point of the proposed PPAD game. As a case study, we apply our method to compare several alternative ln2-privacy mechanisms, the experimental result demonstrates that can provide an effective method to compare equivalent ϵ-privacy mechanisms. Furthermore, the numeric simulation result confirms that the proposed method also be useful for the protector to assess privacy disclosure risks."}

In this paper, we propose a novel resampling ensemble model based on data distribution (REMDD) for imbalanced credit risk evaluation in P2P lending. REMMD solves class imbalance problem by using proposed undersampling method based on majority class data distribution (UMCDD). To further improve classification performance of REMMD, base classifiers with better comprehensive performance on the validation set are used to conduct class prediction. We validate the classification performance of REMDD on the three real and representative P2P lending credit datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that REMDD not only has good prediction performance for both majority class and minority class, but also effectively improves the comprehensive classification performance for imbalanced credit risk evaluation in P2P lending, compared with existing models.'}

For ride-hailing service providers, it is necessary to supervise the demands of customers so that they could carry out reasonable dispatches. To achieve it, a number of data mining methods have been applied. But most of these predicting methods only consider this problem from the temporal aspect, neglecting the connection inter and intra blocks of the city. Blocks are the outputs of region partition, which divides the whole city into a series of divisions. At the same time, the partitioned map, specifying borders of blocks, is useful for platforms to improve the process of supervising, dispatching, and recommending. However, the majority of current partition methods is static and cannot effectively utilize features extracted from historical and geographical operational data. In this work, we propose to conduct partition task with taking distinct situations in different blocks into consideration. In particular, we propose a novel region partition assisted long short term memory neural network for ride-hailing service demand prediction. This is a two-phase model, consisting of the grid-merging region partition and the application of artificial neural network. In experiment part, we show how the region partition method assists LSTM to better forecast the demands, and compare it with other partition techniques.

Meeting the stringent performance requirements regarding jitter for the Common Public Radio Interface (CPRI) over Ethernet is challenging. In this paper, a time division multiplexing (TDM) slot-based scheduling (TSS) algorithm is proposed to minimize the jitter; this algorithm consists of two main modules: slot greedy allocation and low-delay collaboration. Specifically, low-complexity slot greedy allocation aims to solve the NP-hard problem caused by the optimal slot allocation, and the low-delay collaboration among different switches is employed to avoid the large delays caused by a strict slot assignment. In the Ethernet-based fronthaul network, the simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the conventional benchmark algorithm, the TSS algorithm ensures lower jitter, and this significant decrease is achieved without incurring a large delay.'}

Split-screen service, e.g., picture in picture, becomes more and more popular. However, the video transmission of split-screen service still faces several major challenges, one of which is how to assess the users' quality of experience (QoE) of the split-screen service. There may be multiple videos for different resolutions displayed on one screen. A consistent way is needed to assess the users' QoE of the split-screen service. The second challenge is how to choose bitrate of each video stream to maximize users' QoE of the split-screen service. Multiple video streams are transmitted to user over resource-constrained wireless networks. Therefore, it is a difficult issue to select an appropriate bitrate for every video streaming. To address these challenges, in this paper, we first present a dynamic adaptive video transmission scheme (DAVTS) based on MPEG Media Transport (MMT) protocol. Then we introduce a novel mathematical model for characterizing users' QoE to be affected by some factors in the proposed DAVTS. In the model, the objective method of QoE assessment of split-screen service is proposed. Based on the model a problem of maximum income in QoE of users is considered. We use a transmission bitrate selection (TBS) algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that DAVTS can enrich the video quality while reduce video jitters."}

Combined SDN Forwarding Element (CFE), which comprises software switch and hardware switch, becomes an alternative approach for tackling this problem. Because software switch has lower lookup speed than hardware switch, different proportions of traffic allocated to software switches in CFE have different effects on the delay bounds of all flows entering CFE. As delay-guarantee is a nontrivial task for network providers, especially with the increasing number of delay-sensitive applications, a model to analyze the delay bound given a flow allocation in CFE is important. With the one-to-one correspondence between flow allocation and rules placement solution, the analytical model can be used to evaluate and compare rules placement solutions and provide a basis for designing better rules placement solution in CFE.

In this paper, we suggest a new mechanism to mitigate Interest flooding attack. The detection of Interest flooding and the corresponding mitigation measures are implemented on the edge routers, which are directly connected with the attackers. By using statistics of Interest satisfaction rate on the incoming interface of some edge routers, malicious name-prefixes or interfaces can be discovered, and then dropped or slowed down accordingly. With the help of the network information, the detected malicious name-prefixes and interfaces can also be distributed to the whole network quickly, and the attack can be mitigated quickly. The simulation results show that the suggested mechanism can reduce the influence of the Interest flooding quickly, and the network performance can recover automatically to the normal state without hurting the legitimate users.\n\t'}

However, to date, most existing pedestrian localization methods rely on a fixed external infrastructure, such as a global positioning system(GPS) or pre-deployed wifi access points to provide Localization service for mobile devices. Such methods are constrained either by limited GPS coverage or by complicated set-up procedures. We observe that, when two devices are moving, the change of their positions leads to the change of distance between them. Given the same movements, different relative locations between devices lead to different distance changes. Besides, the distance between and relative movement of devices can be measured by two phone-embedded sensors respectively. This motivates us to exploit the relative localization method by merely two mobile devices. In this work, we present Phone-Radar, which is an infrastructure-free device-to-device localization system. According to the propagation model of wireless signals, the change of distance between devices are modeled by the change of wireless signal strength between them. The movements of devices are recorded by the inertial sensors using step-counting method. We further study the relationship among the initial relative locations between the two devices, their relative movements and the change of received signal strength measurements. Moreover, we implement the proposed method and measure its performance under real world conditions. The testbed experiments show the efficiency of our proposed method.'}

By modeling the Internet AS-level topology using a hierarchical graph, we define the processes of prefix assignment and routing advertisement in different hierarchical addressing deployment ways. Then, we quantify the impact of these deployments on the prefix assignment and the routing scalability based on the real routing data. we find that when the deploying position gets lower, the prefix amount of arbitrary AS is getting smaller, while the size of the global Forwarding Information Base is monotonically increasing. Comparing with the actual Internet's data, suitable deployment ways for hierarchical addressing are obtained. With these deployment ways, the excessive prefix problem is solved and the size of the global Forwarding Information Base could be reduced into 56% or even 32% of the one in current Internet."}

Most approaches are mining the association between sentiment words and seed words using the big corpora and manually labeled seed words with definite orientation. But less work has ever focused on the efficient seed words selection. As we observed, emoticons, which are widely used on social network because of the simplicity and visualization, are good indicators for sentiment orientation. Thus this paper proposes the sentiment word model based on emoticons, which built orientation model of sentiment words with the orientation of emoticons, and train the model with the SVM classifier. Meanwhile, this work proposes a high efficient way to automatically classify the orientation of emoticons. Experiments show the precision rate of emoticon classification could reach 93.6%, and that of sentiment words classification could be 81.5%.'}

Due to the spirit of wiki, people, especially some leading users work hard together to make the community a knowledge base of high quality, which in turn attracts more people to take part in this job. Thus, in this study, we focus on detecting leading users within a specific topic area of professional CQA services.

Owing to its widespread use of applications such as email, online shopping, online business networking and instant messaging, OSNs play an indispensable part in people's work and life. People tend to seek information through their OSNs rather than the traditional search engine. This paper presents a hybrid social search model, which harnesses the user's social relation to generate the satisfying results. Upon receiving a user's query, the social search model aims to return a list of ranked answerers who might give the correct answers to that query. Two novel algorithms are proposed to calculate the result ranking: 1) Topic Relevance Rank (TRR) evaluates user's professional score on the relevant topics; 2) Social Relation Rank (SRR) captures the social relation strength between users. In addition, a topic classification label is defined to control the weight of these two algorithms. We describe the architecture of the social search model and give details of the ranking algorithms.

Nowadays, the IP network which can only provide best effort services can not fulfil customers' QoS requirements, and SLA contract signed between service provider and service consumer is proposed to support QoS-based service offering. Service Provider (SP) separated from Network Provider (NP) acts as an independent entity in service provisioning, and needs to negotiate SLA with NP to attain network resource, which enables SP to provide QoS guaranteed services for customers. But in the current Internet, network domains are owned by different network operators and SP and customers may locate in different domains, which makes the SLA negotiation more complicated in QoS-Service provisioning. The initiator-domain-based SLA negotiation system is proposed to meet the negotiation problem."}

With the burst of new applications and the growing scale of data, co-running applications on limited GPU resources has become increasingly important due to its dramatic improvement in overall system efficiency. Quality of service (QoS) support among concurrent general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) applications is currently one of the most trending research topics. Prior efforts have been focused on providing QoS support either with OS-level or device-level scheduling methods. Each of these scheduling methods possesses pros and cons and may be unable to independently cover all the scheduling cases. In this paper, we propose a cooperative QoS scheduling scheme (C-QoS) that consists of operating-system-level (OS-level) scheduling and device-level scheduling. Our proposed scheme can control the progress of a kernel and provide thorough QoS support for concurrent applications in multitasking GPUs. Due to the accurate resource management of the copy engine and execution engine, C-QoS achieves QoS goals 23.33% more often than state-of-the-art QoS support mechanisms. The results demonstrate that cooperative methods achieve 17.27% higher system utilization than uncooperative methods.'}

Split-screen services, such as picture in picture become more and more popular. Furthermore, the user's viewing environment affects the user's quality of experience (QoE). Therefore, video transmission of split-screen services face several major challenges, such as to quantify the impact of environmental factors on user's QoE; how to assess the user's QoE of the split-screen services; how to choose the bit-rate of each video stream to maximize user's QoE of the split-screen services.

Then, we introduce a mathematical model for characterizing user's QoE to be affected by environmental factors in the proposed EAAT. In the model, the QoE of user's relationship with the viewing environment is proposed.

Meanwhile, it also asks for effective service management, data transmission and analysis. Towards this end, software defined networks (SDN) technology is introduced as a key solution to enable IoT network management. When IoT requires an efficient forwarding policy reconfiguration as the response to the alteration of system requirement (e.g., network environment or user demand), SDN is able to adjust the configurations easily to meet its demand. Previous research efforts tried to complete the reconfiguration as quickly as possible, since the update speed is critical to the performance of network management. However, update time can be further reduced. In this paper, we propose a novel update mechanism, which is referred to as rule co-existence update. It is able to enlarge the solution space and obtain more individual solutions, without any negative effect to the packet headers or throughput of flows. Then, we propose a scheme called USA (i.e., Update Speed Accelerator), as a novel algorithm for network updates based on the above-mentioned rule co-existence, that accelerates the update of forwarding policy with spare rule space on current network switches for general IoT environments. Based on the obtained suboptimal greedy solution, USA shows a novel way for rule co-existence to accelerate the update of forwarding policies. It also proposes a simplified algorithm to ensure the forwarding correctness during the update process. Extensive simulation results show that USA can clearly reduce the update time for nearly half of policies in our experiments with few rule space overhead, which is less than 8% of all policies, and maximum update time is less than previous works when spare rule space is limited.'}

If the captured view is not available at the desired viewpoint, virtual views can be rendered from neighboring coded views using view synthesis techniques. Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) is a new standard that allows to adjust the quality of video streaming based on the network condition. In this paper, an improved DASH-based IMVS framework is proposed. It has the following characteristics. First, virtual views could be adaptively generated at either the cloud-based server or the client in our scheme, depending on the network condition and the cost of the cloud. Second, scalable video coding (SVC) is used to improve the flexibility in our system. To optimize the Quality of Experience (QoE) of multiple clients in wireless scenario, we develop a cross-layer optimization scheme. We first propose a new cache management method to selectively store the video data according to SVC structure and the clients’ requesting condition. Next, a cross-layer scheduling scheme is proposed by considering the video rate adaptation and the wireless resource allocation. The optimization problem is shown to be equivalent to the Multiple Choice Knapsack (MCKP) problem. A dynamic programming method and a low-cost greedy method are developed to solve the problem.

Despite all its advantages, separating the control and data planes introduces new challenges regarding resilient communications between the two. That is, disconnections between switches and their controllers could result in substantial packet loss and performance degradation. This paper addresses this challenge by studying the issue of control traffic protection in SDNs with arbitrary numbers of controllers. Specifically, we propose a control traffic protection scheme that combines both local rerouting and constrained reverse path forwarding protections, through which switches can locally react to failures and redirect the control traffic using standby backup forwarding options. Our goal is then to find a set of primary routes for control traffic, called protected control network, where as many switches as possible can benefit from the proposed protection scheme. We formulate the protected control network problem, prove its NP-hardness, and develop an algorithm that reconciles protectability and performance (e.g., switch-to-control latency). Through extensive simulations based on real topologies, we show that our approach significantly improves protectability of control traffic. The results should help further the process of deploying SDN in real-world networks.'}

First, we design an improved mapping scheme from scalable video coding layers to DASH layers that can provide the desired bitrates, enhance the video end-to-end throughput, and reduce the HTTP communication overhead. Second, we develop a DASH-friendly scheduling and resource allocation algorithm by integrating the DASH-based media delivery and the radio-level adaptation via a cross-layer approach. It utilizes the characteristics of video content and scalable video coding, and greatly reduces the possibility of video playback interruption by considering the client buffer status. The optimization problem is formulated as a mixed binary integer programming problem, and is solved by a subgradient method.

Different from other information retrieval tasks, personal photo recommendation depends on the measure of activity relevancy which is implicitly embedded in photos. Spurred by this observation, an enhanced recommendation approach by fusing both contextual and textual features is proposed. First, contextual relevancy is incrementally refined with an enhanced temporal and spatial clustering method respectively. Second, textual similarity of photo annotations is calculated using WordNet to augment the activity relevancy. Third, a fuzzy decision based multi-criteria ranking algorithm i.e., Preference Ranking Organization Method of Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) is adopted to make recommendations when giving an entry photo. A prototype has been developed on mobile device to illustrate this concept. Experiment results on a real dataset which contains 10,827 photos collected from 50 volunteers during 12 months demonstrate that our approach is more accurate than traditional schemes.'}

Impact analysis is an assessment of multiple risks associated with the changes. Research over the past 20 years has shown that impact analysis can decrease the time and effort needed in the development and regression testing and reduce the negative effects of change on other parts of the software system. These researches used program slicing, control flow analysis, call graph to analyze intraprocedural and interprocedural impact. However, most of them only analyze the methods affected by changes of simple variables or statements, which have coarse granularity and can provide limited help. To solve these problems, we propose an improving approach that can analyze the finer granularity change impact of multiple types of variables. This approach first breaks code changes into a combination of basic operations on variables and adopts corresponding analysis mechanisms for different types of variables. The code is preprocessed before analysis to gather essential information such as global variables table, function summaries, and pointer information map. In the intraprocedural analysis, we first divide the variables into two types: definition point and use point. For the use point, a data flow graph is used to analyze its change impact. For the definition point, we first find the paths where it is and analyze the variables on these paths that are controlled by it. In addition, to deal with the change impact of complex variables in the C programs, we have proposed a corresponding analysis procedure and algorithm. In interprocedural analysis, the impacted methods are searched according to their relationship and the global variable information table. A prototype system is developed based on our approach.

Despite the diffuse usage of static analysis tools in automatically detecting potential software defects, developers consider the large number of reported alarms and the expensive cost of manual inspection to be a key barrier to using them in practice. To automate the process of defect identification, researchers utilize machine learning algorithms with a set of hand-engineered features to build classification models for identifying alarms as actionable or unactionable. However, traditional features often fail to represent the deep syntactic structure of alarms. To bridge the gap between programs’ syntactic structure and defect identification features, this paper first extracts a set of novel fine-grained features at variable-level, called path-variable characteristic, by applying path analysis techniques in the feature extraction process. We then raise a two-stage transfer learning approach based on our proposed features, called feature ranking-matching based transfer learning, to increase the performance of cross-project defect identification. Our experimental results for eight open-source projects show that the proposed features at variable-level are promising and can yield significant improvement on both within-project and cross-project defect identification.'}

Aiming at automatically classifying the reported alarms into true defects and false positives, we propose a defect identification model based on machine learning. We design a set of novel features at variable level, called variable characteristics, for building the classification model, which is more fine-grained than the existing traditional features. We select 13 base classifiers and two ensemble learning methods for model building based on our proposed approach, and the reported alarms classified as unactionable (false positives) are pruned for the purpose of mitigating the effort of manual inspection.

One important activity in unit testing is automatic test data generation. Constraint-based test data generation is a technique for automatic generation of test data, which uses symbolic execution to generate constraints. Unit testing only tests functions instead of the whole program, where individual functions typically have preconditions imposed on their inputs. Conventional symbolic execution cannot detect these preconditions, let alone converting these preconditions into constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel unit test data generation approach using rule-directed symbolic execution for dealing with functions with missing input preconditions. Rule-directed symbolic execution uses predefined rules to detect preconditions in the individual function, and generates constraints for inputs based on preconditions. We introduce implicit constraints to represent preconditions, and unify implicit constraints and program constraints into integrated constraints. Test data generated based on integrated constraints can explore previously unreachable code and help developers find more functional faults and logical faults. We have implemented our approach in a tool called CTS-IC, and applied it to real-world projects.

To monitor the underwater environment or any object within a certain area of interest, these applications are required to deploy underwater node sensors connected for obtaining useful data. For thriving UWSNs, it is essential that an efficient and secure node deployment mechanism is in place. This paper presents a novel node deployment scheme, which is based on evidence theory approach and caters for 3D USWNs. This scheme implements sonar probability perception and an enhanced data fusion model to improve prior probability deployment algorithm of D–S evidence theory. The viability of our algorithm is verified by performing multiple simulation experiments. The simulation results reveal that our algorithm deploys fewer nodes with enhanced network judgment criteria and expanded detection capabilities for a relatively large coverage area compared to other schemes.

As different variables in different dimensions of the PEC represent different circuit components such as resistor, capacitor, or inductor, they have different physical significances and various search space that are even not in comparable range. Therefore, the traditional group method used in BSO, which is based on the solution position information, is not suitable when solving PEC. In order to overcome this issue, the NGS proposed in this paper normalizes different dimensions of the solution to the same comparable range. This way, the grouping operator of BSO can work when using BSO to solve PEC. The NGS based BSO (NGBSO) approach has been implemented to optimize the design of a buck regulator in PEC. The results are compared with those obtained by using genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Results show that the NGBSO algorithm outperforms GA and PSO in our PEC design and optimization study. Moreover, the NGS can be regarded as an efficient method to extend BSO to real-world application problems whose dimensions are with different physical significances and search ranges.\n\t'}

We study the high level metrics such as IPC and procedure level profiles as well as lower level measurements such as execution paths exercised by various input sets on the SPEC2000int benchmark. Our study indicates that the test input sets are not suitable to be used for simulation because they do not have an execution profile similar to the reference input runs. The train data set is better than the test data sets at maintaining similar profiles to the reference input set. However, the observed execution paths leading to cache misses are very different between using the smaller input sets and the reference input sets.

For example, the integrated approach improves over computation reuse from a speedup of 1.25 to 1.40, and improves over value prediction from 1.28 to 1.40. In particular, the integrated approach out-performs a computation reuse configuration that has twice as much reuse buffer entries (from a speedup 1.33 to 1.40).

Current task offloading and resource allocation approaches ignore the extra overhead brought by container instance startup. This naturally leads to a long overall latency and high energy consumption. Motivated by the limitations of existing literature, we address task offloading and resource allocation problem considering container instance startup time. We first examine the startup latency of containers started from different types of images, and present its impact on overall performance. Then, we formulate the problem as optimization problem. The problem is hard to address because mutual effects of offloading decision, resource allocation decision and container instance startup contribute to the overall performance. We resort to Gibbs sampling to decouple offloading decision and resource allocation.

Therefore, this work performs comprehensive measurements of on-device training with the state-of-the-art training library, 6 mobile phones, and 5 classical neural networks.

Recently, numerous adaptive streaming algorithms have been proposed to improve the user perceived experience. However, these algorithms were mainly developed from the perspective of single user. There is not yet systematical evaluation and comparison of the bitrate adaptation methods for multi-user video streaming. Besides, the Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics were not unified.In this work, we propose a new mininet-based testbed framework which is able to conduct real-time video streaming emulation in various multi-user scenarios. Seven state-of-the-art adaptation methods are incorporated into the testbed. Meanwhile, ITU-T P.1203 model, the world's first standard for measuring QoE of HTTP adaptive streaming, is implemented to calculate the mean opinion scores of different methods. Using the developed testbed, the performance of current adaptation methods in multi-user network is analyzed and compared. A variety of experiments are carried out by changing the user number and network conditions, in which the QoE of different users are investigated. It is found that current algorithms perform inconsistently in various network scenarios. In the excessive user and limited bandwidth cases, machine learning and scheduling techniques show superiority in providing high and equal QoE for all users. While in the high-delay case, the buffer-based approaches show robust performance.

The service delay of different tasks varies from each other, resulting in a low service reliability. To attack this challenge, this paper focuses on mobile users’ computation offloading problem in wireless cellular networks for purpose of maximizing the number of tasks completed on time. Since the environment states, including available local resources, channel conditions and remaining computation resource of the edge cloud, will vary from time to time, we use the model-free reinforcement learning (RL) framework to formulate and tackle the computation offloading problem. The agent learns through interactions with the environment to decide executing task locally on the mobile device or offloading the task to the edge cloud via the wireless link for each mobile device user. Considering high-dimensional state spaces, we use deep Q-learning (DQN) which combines reinforcement learning method Q-learning and deep neural network (DNN) to obtain the optimal approach.

The traditional centralized machine learning method, where data is collected from end-users or IoT devices, so that it can discover insights behind real-world data, may not be feasible for many data-driven industry applications in light of such regulations. A new machine learning method, coined by Google as Federated Learning (FL) enables multiple participants to train a machine learning model collectively without directly exchanging data. However, recent studies have shown that there is still a possibility to exploit the shared models to extract personal or confidential data. In this paper, we propose to adopt Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to achieve privacy-preserving model aggregation for FL. The MPC-enabled model aggregation in a peer-to-peer manner incurs high communication overhead with low scalability. To address this problem, the authors proposed to develop a two-phase mechanism by 1) electing a small committee and 2) providing MPC-enabled model aggregation service to a larger number of participants through the committee. The MPC-enabled FL framework has been integrated in an IoT platform for smart manufacturing.

In recent years, deep neural networks have become the mainstream approach in cognitive service, and mobile edge computing facilitates a variety of cognitive services for users by offloading computation tasks from resource-limited mobile devices to relatively wealthy edge servers. Combining the two to provide users with a higher quality of cognitive service is an issue worth researching. However, many related studies are not easy to provide fast responses because in these systems, edge servers are only used to pre-process data, and the cloud server is used to perform tasks. In this paper, we aim to study deploying deep neural network models on edge servers to provide fast services. However, a single edge server collects only a small amount of data, which results in low inference accuracy. To address this problem, we propose a cloud and edge collaboration framework.

However, the heterogeneity of edge resource capacities and mismatch of edge storage and computation capacities make it difficult to fully utilize both the storage and computation capacities in the absence of edge cooperation. To address this issue, we consider cooperation among edge nodes and investigate cooperative service caching and workload scheduling in mobile edge computing. This problem can be formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, which has non-polynomial computation complexity. Addressing this problem faces challenges of sub-problem coupling, computation-communication tradeoff, and edge node heterogeneity. We develop an iterative algorithm named ICE to solve this problem.

In order to promote the healthy development of the service ecosystem, it is necessary to guarantee the fairness of unpopular services. To address this problem, this paper proposes a fairness-aware mobile service recommendation method (FMSR), which gives a relatively fair recommendation opportunity for unpopular services. FMSR makes a tradeoff between recommendation accuracy and fairness, and can recommend popular services and unpopular services respectively. For unpopular services, we design a fair efficiency function and use combinatorial optimization techniques to achieve recommendations. For popular services, bias matrix factorization is utilized to implement recommendations.

To this end, we propose CMIP, an innovative approach that aims to minimize the TDTL by renting virtual machines of well-connected datacenters as the proxy for the cooperative group scenario in multi-cloud providers. First, a weighted graph is constructed to illustrate the multi-cloud network. Second, we define a path latency model and a rental cost model for the cooperative group. After that, Yen's algorithm and mixed integer programming are adopted to optimize the TDTL with rental cost constraint. To study the performance of CMIP, we conduct extensive evaluations using multiple real data traces and compare it with related approaches. The comprehensive evaluation analysis shows that the CMIP achieves much lower total latency and is more flexible than other approaches."}

QoECenter offers a holistic approach to conducting the QoE evaluations via an integrated set of technologies for source video classification, QoS realization of video encoding and network transmission, and context-aware user experience data gathering and analysis. From a QoECenter consumer's viewpoint, three kinds of data are required for an end-to-end streaming video QoE evaluation: video source level data, system process level data, and end user level data. QoECenter provides visual interfaces for parameter setting and data acquisition for each data level, and supports both objective and subjective datadriven QoE analyses. A QoECenter consumer can easily conduct comparative QoE evaluations like running easy-to-use visual applications. The effectiveness and efficiency design objectives of QoECenter have been validated by various real experiments."}

On one hand, we propose a transportation mode classification model based on a deep architecture formed by an SAE model to further improve the inference performance. On the other hand, the relevant features related to the underlying transportation network information are redefined and considered to improve the final classification efficiency and effectiveness. Five representative travel modes-walking, cycling, taking a bus, taking a subway, and driving-are distinguished. Four different models including Bayesian Net, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine are compared with our model and tested with the GPS trajectory data in Beijing.

However, the navigation system (such as GPS navigation system) and apps (such as Waze) may not be possible for each individual user to avoid traffic without creating congestion on the clearer roads, and it might even be that such a recommendation leads to longer aggregate routes. To solve this dispersion, in this paper, we first apply a concept of virtual vehicle in IoV, which is an image of driver and vehicle. Then, we study a setting of non-atomic routing in a network of m parallel links with symmetry of information. While a virtual vehicle knows the cost function associated with links, they are known to the individual virtual vehicles choosing the link. The virtual vehicles adapt the cooperation approach via strategic concession game, trying to minimize the individual and total travel time. How much benefit of travel time by the virtual vehicles cooperating when vehicles follow the cooperation decisions? We study the concession ratio: the ratio between the concession equilibrium obtained from an individual optimum and the social optimum. We find that cooperation approach can reduce the efficiency loss compared to the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium. In particular, in the case of two links with affine cost functions, the concession ratio is at most 3/2. For general non-decrease cost functions, the concession ratio is at most 2. For the strategic concession game, the concession ratio can approach to 1 which is a significant improvement over the unbounded price of anarchy.KeywordsInternet of vehiclesRoute choiceVirtual vehicleStrategic concession game'}

The proposed scheme works by allowing IVs to evaluate each other, communicate and finally converge to a consensus where some trustworthy Cluster Head (CH) are generated. Periodically, the CHs take responsibility for intra-cluster trust management. Moreover, the scheme is enhanced with a distributed supervising mechanism and a central reputation arbitrator.

QoS measure should be a co-action of both user preferences and services set, and therefore neglecting the data distribution characteristics of services set have weakened the accuracy of measure results. We present in this paper a novel QoS measure algorithm for Web services employing the subjective and objective weight. The subjective weight is used to quantify ambiguous user preferences and the objective weight is used to correct the one-sidedness of user preference.

The successive MEC network combines the networking and computation at the edge of the network to achieve the Quality of Services (QoS) with ultralow latency. The devices with mobility feature, whether hand-held devices or vehicles move from one edge server (ES) location to another ES, creates a nonoptimal environment in the long run. To maintain QoS and avoid service disruptions, existing network topologies do not fulfill the requirement. Hence, a unique traffic steering with dynamic path selection is required for live service migration of time-sensitive applications. In this article, we are the first to introduce a distributed traffic steering through the differentiation of two different types of network elements (i.e., ESs and routers), in a large MEC system. Using this concept, we, for the first time, resolve the scalability problem of a large MEC network into a partitioned MEC network. The proposed framework bounds the path-finding procedure with a filter strategy based on the network distance to eliminate the excess of nonrelated network elements. With a decentralized framework for MEC, we propose matrix-based dynamic shortest path selection and matrix-based dynamic multipath searching algorithms for dynamic path selection under the proposed autonomous network boundary discovery and must connect node block benchmarks.

The hierarchical MEC structure in the 5G network causes extra complication, and the cost of service deployment aggravates the hardness, especially for service providers. In this article, we focus on the service deployment problem considering service caching, resource allocation, and task scheduling in the hierarchical MEC network, aiming at minimizing monetary cost.

However, most of the existing studies either overlooked the problem of collaborative service caching or failed to consider the system's long-term service cost and latency. In this paper, to address such a problem, we coordinate multiple edge servers to cache service items and formulate the collaborative service caching problem using a multi-agent multi-armed bandit model.

Due to the lack of global information when users request data rate, we reformulate users’ data rate requesting problem as a POMDP problem. A novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm is adopted to solve the problem. Evaluation and simulation results show the proposed viewport prediction and VR streaming schemes outperform conventional solutions in terms of prediction accuracy and VR viewing experience.'}

Artificial intelligence (AI), which deals with the simulation of intelligent behavior in computers, has demonstrated enormous success in many application domains, suggesting its potential in cognizing the state of an MN and making intelligent decisions. In this article, we first propose an AI-powered MN architecture and discuss challenges in terms of cognition complexity, decisions with high-dimensional action space, and self-adaptation to system dynamics. Then potential solutions associated with AI are discussed. Finally, we propose a deep learning approach that directly maps the state of an MN to perceived QoS, integrating cognition with the decision.

Prior work on deep learning models-based mobile applications in a cloud-edge computing environment focuses on performing lightweight data pre-processing tasks on edge servers for cloud-hosted cognitive servers. These approaches have two major limitations. First, it is uneasy for the mobile applications to assure satisfactory user experience in terms of network communication delay, because the intermediary edge servers are used only to pre-process data (e.g., images and videos) and the cloud servers are used to complete the tasks. Second, these approaches assume the pre-trained deep learning models deployed on cloud servers are static, and will not attempt to automatically upgrade in a context-aware manner. In this article, we propose a cloud-edge collaboration framework that facilitates delivering cognitive services with long-lasting, fast response, and high accuracy properties. We fist deploy a shallow model (i.e., EdgeCNN) on the edge server and a deep model (i.e., CloudCNN) on the cloud server. EdgeCNN can provide durable and rapid response cognitive services, because edge servers not only provide computing resources for mobile applications, but also close to users. Then, we enable CloudCNN to assist in training EdgeCNN to improve the performance of the latter. Thus, EdgeCNN also provides high-accuracy cognitive services. Furthermore, because users may continue to upload data to edge servers in real-world scenarios, we propose to use the ongoing assistance of CloudCNN to further improve the accuracy of the shallow model. Experimental results show that EdgeCNN can reduce the average response time of cognitive services by up to 55.08 percent and improve accuracy by up to 26.70 percent.'}

The user experience can be considerably affected when many mobile users compete for the limited communication and computation resources. The key technical challenge in task offloading is to guarantee the Quality of Service (QoS) for such applications. Existing work on task offloading focus on deterministic QoS (delay) guarantee, which means that tasks have to complete before the given deadline with 100 percent. However, it is impractical to impose a deterministic QoS guarantee for tasks due to the high dynamics of the wireless environment when offloading to edge servers. In this paper, we focus on task offloading with statistical QoS guarantee (tasks are allowed to complete before a given deadline with a probability above the given threshold), which can further save more energy by loosing the QoS requirement. Specially, we first propose a statistical computation model and a statistical transmission model to quantify the correlation between the statistical QoS guarantee and task offloading strategy. Then, we formulate the task offloading problem as a mixed integer non-Linear programming problem with the statistical delay constraint. We transform the statistical delay constraint into the constraints on CPU cycle numbers and the delay exponent respectively. We propose an algorithm to provide the statistical QoS guarantee for tasks using convex optimization theory and Gibbs sampling method. Experiment results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the three baselines.'}

In this paper, we propose a resource-aware feature extraction framework for mobile image recognition services. The proposed framework consists of discriminative feature extraction (DFE) and NestDFE algorithms. The DFE algorithm can generate an extractor \nE{{\\mathbf E}}\n to extract discriminative features from the image data set on the edge server and images on mobile devices. Thus, the proposed framework can achieve higher recognition accuracy and require mobile devices to upload less feature data to the edge server. The NestDFE algorithm generates a single multi-capacity extractor that acts as a series of sub-extractors and enables mobile devices to dynamically select sub-extractors.

A huge number of devices have been connected to the Internet and created zettabytes of data items. To extract value from such massive data volumes, processing power offered by cloud computing is often utilized. However, streaming data to the cloud exposes some limitations related to increased communication and data transfer, which introduces delays and consumes network bandwidth. Another limitation that cloud-based computing for IoT poses is a limited or no network connectivity. Other problems with cloud-based processing of IoT generated data regard the sensitivity of the information, because sending and storing so much information in the cloud involves privacy and security challenges, related to the protection of personally identifiable information, storing it in compliance with privacy laws, securing stored information, and preventing from being stolen, or accessed and shared illegally. The use of AI in edge processing resulted in a new interdisciplinary field that enables distributed intelligence with edge devices and is known as edge AI or edge intelligence. However, research on edge AI is still relatively new, and thus models, techniques, and protocols supporting intelligent management, querying and mining of large-scale amounts of data produced at the edge are required. A lot of challenges related to providing edge intelligence include training edge devices, so they can become more and more smart.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate the reliability of the entire service. In this article, we use Petri Net as a basis for modeling the composition of services. In addition, we consider the problems of shared resources and common cause faults. Both of these problems can cause network congestion and regional failures. We use distance to assess the effects of regional faults and queuing theory to simulate the network congestion process. Moreover, in the simulation, we verify the impacts of regional failures and network congestion on service reliability. We choose the Tree-Based Search algorithm and the Semi-Markov Model as comparison algorithms. The results of our algorithm are related to service time. Our algorithm can timely reflect the impact of regional failure or network congestion, and it can feedback different evaluation results according to environmental changes.

With the assistance of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), IoT devices are able to access the network via aerial base stations. These UAV-assisted IoT applications still face security and energy challenges. The open environment of IoT applications makes the application easy to encounter external invasion. Limited energy of UAV results in the limited lifetime of network access. To address these challenges, researches on IoT security and energy efficiency are becoming hotspots. Nevertheless, in the UAV continuous coverage scenario, there is still an enormous potential to improve the security and efficiency of data collection in IoT applications. In this article, blockchain is introduced into the scene of UAV-assisted IoT, and a data collection system considering security and energy efficiency is proposed. In this system, UAV, as an edge data collection node, provides a long-term network access for IoT devices through regular cruises with recharging. By forwarding data and recording transactions, UAVs get charging coins as rewards. UAVs use charging coins to exchange charging time. UAV swarm builds distributed ledgers based on blockchain to resist the invasion of malicious UAV. In order to reduce energy consumption, this article designs an adaptive linear prediction algorithm. Through this algorithm, IoT devices upload prediction model instead of original data to greatly reduce in-network transmissions. Simulation results show that the proposed system can effectively improve the security and efficiency of data collection.'}

In mobile-edge computing, reducing the computation offloading cost of mobile users and maintaining fresh information at edge nodes are two critical while conflicted objectives, as both consume the limited wireless bandwidth of edge nodes. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to optimizing computation offloading decisions and some works have investigated freshness-aware channel allocation issues recently, no prior works have considered the above conflict. This article is the first work to jointly optimize the channel allocation and computation offloading decisions, aiming at reducing the computation offloading cost within freshness requirements of sensors. We analyze the recursiveness of Age of Information (AoI) in analogy to the evolvement of a queue and formulate the problem as a nonlinear integer dynamic optimization problem. To overcome the challenges of AoI-computation cost tradeoff, AoI time dependency and high complexity caused by the heterogeneity of users, we propose an algorithm to solve the problem with reduced computation complexity. Specifically, we first transform the original problem into a static optimization problem in each time slot (which is NP-hard) based on Lyapunov optimization techniques. To reduce the computation complexity, we exploit the finite improvement property of potential games and further enforce centralized control to reduce the number of improvement iterations. Simulations have been conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm shows good effectiveness and scalability.'}

In this article, we study how to minimize the latency with cost limitation by means of jointly deploying edge servers and UPFs in 6G scenario. We have shown that the problem is NP-hard. Then, we simplify the problem by analyzing the placement relationship between edge servers and UPFs and prune the solution space of the problem. To solve the problem effectively, a UPF and edge server placement algorithm is proposed. Massive experiments are conducted based on real-world data set and an edge core network emulator.

Traditional deep learning training requires users to upload a local dataset to a cloud center, and trains the data using massive computation resources of the cloud center. However, it results in two bad effects: uploading a local dataset to a centralized cloud center controlled by a third party leaves user data privacy at risk; and uploading multimedia data will consume huge bandwidth resources of mobile users and storage resources of the cloud center, resulting in low scalability in term of the number of edge devices. To deal with these two problems, we propose an edge-enabled distributed deep learning platform by dividing a general deep learning training network into a front and back subnetwork. Specifically, the front subnetwork consisting of several layers is deployed close to input data and is trained separately at each edge device using the local dataset, and the outputs of all front subnetworks are sent to the back subnetwork for later training at a cloud center; while the back subnetwork is deployed at the cloud center, and its output is sent to each front subnetwork. As no original dataset is transferred from edge devices to the cloud center, the platform can protect data privacy and has high scalability. Above that, another two measures are taken to ensure data privacy: asymmetric encryption technology is adopted to guarantee the safety and integrality of the transferred parameters between edge servers and the cloud center; and blockchain technology is used to monitor the actions of the stakeholders in this platform and thereby ensure trust among the stakeholders. Experimental results show the validation of the proposed method.'}

With virtualization technologies and multi-access edge computing, data transmission and data processing in SAGINs are abstracted as services.

However, it is significant but very challenging to provide Internet of Things service with high QoS in space-air-ground service computing due to the distributed service management, and the mobility of both infrastructures and users. Therefore, in this article, we investigate service coordination to guarantee the QoS in space-air-ground service computing. In particular, we first introduce three service coordination scenarios: fine-grained, medium-grained, and coarse-grained service coordination. Then we design a service coordination framework that contains three tiers: edge node tier, service function routing tier, and global control tier. After that, we propose a service coordination approach to reduce the service delay at low cost, which considers the selection with foresight and updates based on threshold.

With limited communication time between low earth orbit (LEO) sensing satellites and the ground, geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite relaying has become an effective solution. In practical applications, one GEO communication satellite usually needs to provide data forwarding services for multiple satellites or even multiple satellite constellations. Therefore, communication resource management of GEO satellites has become crucial. Existing methods only focus on resource allocation without taking data forwarding task scheduling into consideration, which limits their applicability in real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a real-time resource management approach for GEO relaying, aiming to maximize network throughputs as well as to reduce transmission delays. In this approach, resource allocation is modeled as a Stackelberg game while task scheduling is modeled as a real-time queuing problem. Furthermore, we propose two real-time algorithms, including an adaptive gradient descent method to find optimal price for data forwarding services with low computational complexity, and a queue-jumping algorithm for data forwarding scheduling to minimize transmission delays. With comparison with existing methods, simulations verify the effectiveness of our proposed method with respect to convergence speed of the algorithm, network throughputs, and transmission delays.'}

As the amount of user requests is time-varying, while the computation capacity of edge hosts is limited, Cloud Assisted Mobile Edge (CAME) computing framework is introduced to improve the scalability of the edge platform. By outsourcing mobile requests to clouds with various types of instances, the CAME framework can accommodate dynamic mobile requests with diverse quality of service requirements. In order to provide guaranteed services at minimal system cost, the edge resource provisioning and cloud outsourcing of the CAME framework should be carefully designed in a cost-efficient manner. Specifically, two fundamental issues should be answered: (1) what is the optimal edge computation capacity configuration? and (2) what types of cloud instances should be tenanted and what is the amount of each type? To solve these issues, we formulate the resource provisioning in CAME framework as an optimization problem. By exploiting the piecewise convex property of this problem, the Optimal Resource Provisioning (ORP) algorithms with different instances are proposed, so as to optimize the computation capacity of edge hosts and meanwhile dynamically adjust the cloud tenancy strategy. The proposed algorithms are proved to be with polynomial computational complexity. To evaluate the performance of the ORP algorithms, extensive simulations and experiments are conducted based on both the widely-used traffic models and the Google cluster usage tracelogs, respectively. It is shown that the proposed ORP algorithms outperform the local-first and cloud-first benchmark algorithms in system flexibility and cost-efficiency.'}

However, existing related works suffer from two major limitations. (i) High network bandwidth cost: they need to extract numerous features from the image and upload these feature data to the cloud server. (ii) Lowretrieval accuracy: they separate the feature extraction processes from the image data set in the cloud server, thus unable to provide effective features for accurate image retrieval. In this paper, we propose a cloud-guided feature extraction approach for mobile image retrieval. In the proposed approach, the cloud server first leverages the relationships among labeled images in the data set to learn a projection matrix P. Then, it uses the matrix P to extract discriminative features from the image data set and form a low-dimensional feature data set. Following that, the cloud server sends the matrix P to the edge server and uses it to multiply the image χ. The result PTχ, i.e., image features, is uploaded to the cloud server to find the label of the image with the most similar multiplying result. The label is regarded as the retrieval result and returned to the mobile user. In the cloud-guided feature extraction approach, the matrix P can extract a small number of effective image features, which not only reduces network traffic but also improves retrieval accuracy. We have implemented a prototype system to validate the proposed approach and evaluate its performance by conducting extensive experiments using a real MEC environment and data set. The experimental results show that the proposed approach reduces the network traffic by nearly 93 percent and improves the retrieval accuracy by nearly 6.9 percent compared with the state-of-the-art image retrieval approaches in MEC.'}

With mobile edge computing, microservices can be further deployed in edge clouds dynamically, launched quickly, and migrated across edge clouds easily, providing better services for users in proximity. However, the user mobility can result in frequent switch of nearby edge clouds, which increases the service delay when users move away from their serving edge clouds. To address this issue, this article investigates microservice coordination among edge clouds to enable seamless and real-time responses to service requests from mobile users. The objective of this work is to devise the optimal microservice coordination scheme which can reduce the overall service delay with low costs. To this end, we first propose a dynamic programming-based offline microservice coordination algorithm, that can achieve the globally optimal performance. However, the offline algorithm heavily relies on the availability of the prior information such as computation request arrivals, time-varying channel conditions and edge cloud's computation capabilities required, which is hard to be obtained. Therefore, we reformulate the microservice coordination problem using Markov decision process framework and then propose a reinforcement learning-based online microservice coordination algorithm to learn the optimal strategy. Theoretical analysis proves that the offline algorithm can find the optimal solution while the online algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance. Furthermore, based on two real-world datasets, i.e., the Telecom's base station dataset and Taxi Track dataset from Shanghai, experiments are conducted. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed online algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of service delay and migration costs, and the achieved performance is close to the optima..."}

In this article, we focus on the parallelized SFC placement problem in DCN considering availability guarantee and resource optimization. Firstly, we define the parallelized SFC and propose a multi-flow backup model. The parallelized SFC consists of multiple parallelized sub-SFCs. We split large data flow into multiple small sub-flows, each of them can be transmitted in one sub-SFC. The backup model provides backup sub-SFCs for working sub-SFCs to improve availability. Finally, we design three placement strategies and a Hybrid Placement Algorithm (HPA) aimed at mapping SFCs to DCN. Evaluation results show that our proposed solutions outperform the related work.

The Internet has bred the ubiquitous computing environment that is spanning the cloud, edge, mobile devices, and IoT. Software running over such a ubiquitous computing environment environment is eating the world. A recently emerging trend of Internet-based software systems is “resource adaptive,” i.e., software systems should be robust and intelligent enough to the changes of heterogeneous resources, both physical and logical, provided by their running environment. To keep pace of such a trend, we argue that some considerations should be taken into account for the future operating system design and implementation. From the structural perspective, rather than the “monolithic OS” that manages the aggregated resources on the single machine, the OS should be dynamically composed over the distributed resources and flexibly adapt to the resource and environment changes. Meanwhile, the OS should leverage advanced machine/deep learning techniques to derive configurations and policies and automatically learn to tune itself and schedule resources. This article envisions our recent thinking of the new OS abstraction, namely, ServiceOS, for future resource-adaptive intelligent software systems. The idea of ServiceOS is inspired by the delivery model of “Software-as-a-Service” that is supported by the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). The key principle of ServiceOS is based on resource disaggregation, resource provisioning as a service, and learning-based resource scheduling and allocation. The major goal of this article is not providing an immediately deployable OS. Instead, we aim to summarize the challenges and potentially promising opportunities and try to provide some practical implications for researchers and practitioners.'}

However, these approaches are implemented without considering the energy and network resource consumption of the composite services. The increases in energy and network resource consumption resulting from these compositions can incur a high cost in data centers. In this paper, the trade-off among QoS performance, energy consumption, and network resource consumption in a service composition process is first analyzed. Then, a green service composition approach is proposed. It gives priority to those composite services that are hosted on the same virtual machine, physical server, or edge switch with end-to-end QoS guarantee. It fulfills the green service composition optimization by minimizing the energy and network resource consumption on physical servers and switches in cloud data centers. Experimental results indicate that, with comparisons to other approaches, our approach saves 20-50 percent of energy consumption and 10-50 percent of network resource consumption.'}

These massive data needs to be stored, transmitted, and processed in time to exploit their value for decision making. Conventional cloud computing requires transmission of massive amount of data in and out of core network, which can lead to longer service latency and potential traffic congestion. As a new platform, mobile edge computing (MEC) moves computation and storage resources to edge network in proximity to the data source. With MEC, data can be processed locally, and thus mitigate issues of latency and congestion. However, it is very challenging to reap the benefits of MEC everywhere due to geographic constraints, expensive deployment cost, and immoveable base stations. Because of easy deployment and high mobility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), air-ground integrated mobile edge networks (AGMEN) is proposed, where UAVs are employed to assist the MEC network. Such an AGMEN expects to provide MEC services ubiquitously and reliably. In this article, we first introduce the characteristics and components of UAV. Then, we will review the applications, key challenges, and current research technologies of AGMEN, from perspectives of communication, computation, and caching, respectively. Finally, we will discuss some essential research directions for AGMEN.'}

However, with the recent introduction of container as a service by cloud providers, containers are increasingly popular and will become the major deployment model in the cloud environment and specifically in platform as a service. Therefore, reducing power consumption while complying with the SLA at virtual machine (VM)-level becomes essential. In this context, we exploit a container consolidation scheme with usage prediction to achieve the above objectives. To obtain a reliable characterization of overutilized and underutilized PMs, our scheme jointly exploits the current and predicted CPU utilization based on local history of the considered PMs in the process of the container consolidation. We demonstrate our solution through simulations on real workloads. The experimental results show that the container consolidation scheme with usage prediction reduces the power consumption, number of container migrations, and average number of active VMs while complying with the SLA.'}

This integration of these worlds with various resource as services requires service composition approaches that can integrate essential components and share relevant information in these worlds. Although numerous service composition approaches have been proposed, there still exist many challenges in the representation of user preference of service composition in cyber–physical–social systems. In this paper, a service composition approach based on the cultural distance is proposed to improve the reliability and satisfaction. This approach employs the cultural distance to measure the user preference quantitatively in a simple mathematical form. The user preference degree and the user preference vector are defined to select the service from a global view and an accurate point separately. Then, a 0-1 mixed-integer programming algorithm is used to identify the most suitable services for composition. The experimental results based on two real-world datasets show that the proposed approach for representing the user preference quantitatively is more simple and effective than other approaches.

The tasks can be scheduled to different mobile-edge computing servers on RSUs for execution to minimize the average completion time of multiple applications. Considering the completion time constraint of each application and the processing dependency of multiple tasks belonging to the same application, we formulate the multiple tasks scheduling problem as an optimization problem that is NP-hard.

To ensure QoS of latency-sensitive services in vehicular networks, service migration is required to migrate data of the ongoing services to the closest ES seamlessly when users move across different ESs. To achieve seamless service migration, path selection is proposed to obtain one or more paths (consisting of several switches and ESs) to transfer service data. We focus on the following problems about path selection: 1) where to implement path selection? 2) how to coordinate interests of mobile users (i.e., vehicles) and network providers since they have conflicting interests during path selection? and 3) how to ensure seamless service migration during the migration of vehicles? To address the above problems, this article investigates path selection for seamless service migration. We propose a path-selection algorithm to jointly optimize both interests of the network plane (i.e., the cost for network providers) and service plane (i.e., QoE of users). We first formulate it as a multiobjective optimization problem and further prove theoretically that the proposed algorithm can give a \nweakly Pareto-optimal solution\n. Moreover, to improve the scalability of the proposed algorithm, a distance-based filter strategy is designed to eliminate undesired switches in advance. We conduct experiments on two synthesized data sets and the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.'}

Mobile edge computing offers an IT service environment at the Radio Access Network edge and presents great opportunities for the development of IoT applications. With the capability to reduce latency and offer an improved user experience, mobile edge computing becomes a key technology toward 5G. To achieve abundant sharing, complex IoT applications have been implemented as a set of lightweight micro-services that are distributed among containers over the mobile edge network. How to produce the optimal collocation of suitable micro-service for an application in mobile edge computing environment is an important issue that should be addressed.

Various service selection approaches in support of service composition on demand have been proposed. They usually assume that networking resources are over-provisioned and their usage needs not be considered when making quality-aware service composition decisions. In practice, these approaches often lead to wasteful network resource consumption and impractical end-to-end QoS optimality for cloud-based services. This paper proposes a network-aware cloud service composition approach, named NetMIP, with comparative experimental evaluations for the clouds that adopt the widely deployed fat-tree network topology. By formalizing the service composition goal as a multi-objective constraint optimization problem, we have validated the proposed approach can be used to effectively reduce network resource consumption and deliver QoS optimality while satisfying the end-to-end QoS constraints for the candidate composite services in the cloud. The comparative experimental evaluations are done via a credible cloud infrastructure simulation system, named WebCloudSim. Extensive evaluation results show that NetMIP outperforms several representative cloud service composition approaches in terms of network resource consumption, QoS optimality, and computation time under various service selection workloads and fat-tree network topology settings.'}

Virtual machines (VMs) of a virtual cluster (VC) must be allocated on physical machines (PMs) in the datacenter with a certain topology. Each VM needs some resources to run various services. Apparently, allocating VMs in the datacenter as compactly as possible can reduce traffic consumption and avoid bandwidth-related bottlenecks. However, loose allocation scheme can reduce the loss expectation of VMs due to failure possibilities of PMs and switches, and the availability of the VC is increased thereby.

K-fault tolerance is a typical replication strategy employed in cloud. However, currently proposed K-fault tolerance replication strategies cannot achieve the best effect due to the ignorance of switch failure. In this paper, we study to design a (m, n)-fault tolerance virtual machine placement algorithm to solve the problem. Firstly, we formulate the problem as an integer linear programming problem, and prove that the problem is NP-hard.

Mobile edge computing platform enables application developers and content providers to serve context-aware services (such as service recommendation) by using real time radio access network information. In service recommendation system, quality of service (QoS) prediction plays an important role when mobile devices or users want to invoke services that can satisfy user QoS requirements. However, user mobility (e.g., from one edge server to another) often makes service QoS prediction values deviate from actual values in traditional mobile networks. Unfortunately, many existing service recommendation approaches fail to consider user mobility. In this paper, we propose a service recommendation approach based on collaborative filtering and make QoS prediction based on user mobility. This approach initially calculates user or edge server similarity and selects the Top-K most-similar neighbors, predicts service QoS, and then makes service recommendation.

In this paper, we consider four key evaluation indices of a crowdsourcing community (i.e., quality, cost, latency, and platform improvement), and demonstrate that these indices involve the interests of the three stakeholders, namely the requester, worker, and crowdsourcing platform. Since the incentives among these three stakeholders always conflict with each other, to elevate the long-term development of the crowdsourcing community, we take the perspective of the whole crowdsourcing community, and design a crowdsourcing mechanism to align incentives of stakeholders together. Specifically, we give workers reward or penalty according to their reporting solutions instead of only nonnegative payment. Furthermore, we find a series of proper reward-penalty function pairs and compute workers personal order values, which can provide different amounts of reward and penalty according to both the workers reporting beliefs and their individual history performances, and keep the incentive of workers at the same time. The proposed mechanism can help latency control, promote quality and platform evolution of crowdsourcing community, and improve the aforementioned four key evaluation indices.

The existing RFID protocols that seem to address this problem suffer from either low time-efficiency or the information corruption issue. To overcome their limitations, we first propose a basic classification protocol called Range Query (RQ), in which each tag pseudo-randomly chooses a slot from the time frame and uses the ON-OFF Keying modulation to reply its range identifier. Then, RQ employs a collaborative decoding method to extract the tag range information from singleton and even collision slots. The numerical results reveal that the number of queried ranges significantly affects the performance of RQ. To optimize the number of queried ranges, we further propose the Partition&Mergence (PM) approach that consists of two steps, i.e., top-down partitioning and bottom-up merging. Sufficient theoretical analyses are proposed to optimize the involved parameters, thereby minimizing the time cost of RQ+PM or minimizing its energy cost. We can trade off between time cost and energy cost by adjusting the related parameters. The prominent advantages of the RQ+PM protocol over previous protocols are two-fold: (i) it is able to make use of the collision slots, which are treated as useless in previous protocols. Thus, frame utilization can be significantly improved; (ii) it is immune to the interference from unexpected tags, and does not suffer information corruption issue. We use USRP and WISP tags to conduct a set of experiments, which demonstrate the feasibility of RQ+PM. Extensive simulation results reveal that RQ+PM can ensure 100% query accuracy, and reduce the time cost as much as 40% when comparing with the state-of-the-art protocols.'}

Chang': '68/4237'}, 'abstract': " Abstract:Advances in mobile Internet technology have enabled the clients of Web services to be able to keep their service sessions alive while they are on the move. Since the services consumed by a mobile client may be different over time due to client location changes, a multi-dimensional spatiotemporal model is necessary for analyzing the service consumption relations. Moreover, competitive Web service recommenders for the mobile clients must be able to predict unknown quality-of-service (QoS) values well by taking into account the target client's service requesting time and location, e.g., performing the prediction via a set of multi-dimensional QoS measures. Most contemporary QoS prediction methods exploit the QoS characteristics for one specific dimension, e.g., time or location, and do not exploit the structural relationships among the multi-dimensional QoS data. This paper proposes an integrated QoS prediction approach which unifies the modeling of multi-dimensional QoS data via multi-linear-algebra based concepts of tensor and enables efficient Web service recommendation for mobile clients via tensor decomposition and reconstruction optimization algorithms. In light of the unavailability of measured multi-dimensional QoS datasets in the public domain, this paper also presents a transformational approach to creating a credible multi-dimensional QoS dataset from a measured taxi usage dataset which contains high dimensional time and space information. Comparative experimental evaluation results show that the proposed QoS prediction approach can result in much better accuracy in recommending Web services than several other representative ones."}

To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose SpotCloudSim to support for dynamic virtual machine pricing model simulation. SpotCloudSim provides an extensible interface to help researchers implement new spot virtual machine purchasing approach. In addition, SpotCloudSim can also study the behavior of the newly proposed spot virtual machine purchasing approaches. We demonstrate the capabilities of SpotCloudSim by using three spot virtual machine purchasing approaches. The results indicate the benefits of our proposed simulation system.'}

IT solution and service organizations have come forth with a number of automated traffic management solutions and the primary problem with them is they are unfortunately reactive and hence an inefficient solution for the increasingly connected and dynamic city environments. Therefore, unveiling real-time, adaptive, precision-centric and predictive traffic monitoring, measurement, management and enhancement solutions are being insisted as an indispensable requirement toward sustainable cities.

To enhance cloud service reliability, two types of fault tolerance schemes, reactive and proactive, have been proposed. Existing schemes rarely consider the problem of coordination among multiple virtual machines (VMs) that jointly complete a parallel application. Without VM coordination, the parallel application execution results will be incorrect. To overcome this problem, we first propose an initial virtual cluster allocation algorithm according to the VM characteristics to reduce the total network resource consumption and total energy consumption in the data center. Then, we model CPU temperature to anticipate a deteriorating physical machine (PM). We migrate VMs from a detected deteriorating PM to some optimal PMs. Finally, the selection of the optimal target PMs is modeled as an optimization problem that is solved using an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm. We evaluate our approach against five related approaches in terms of the overall transmission overhead, overall network resource consumption, and total execution time while executing a set of parallel applications. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.'}

How to select the optimal composited service from a set of functionally equivalent services with different quality of service (QoS) attributes has become an active focus of research in the service community. However, existing middleware solutions or approaches are inefficient as they search all solution spaces. More importantly, they inherently neglect QoS uncertainty owing to the dynamic network environment. In this paper, based on a service composition middleware framework, we propose an efficient and reliable service selection approach that attempts to select the best reliable composited service by filtering low-reliability services through the computation of QoS uncertainty. The approach first employs information theory and probability theory to abandon high-QoS-uncertainty services and downsize the solution space. A reliability fitness function is then designed to select the best reliable service for composited services. We experimented with real-world and synthetic datasets and compared our approach with other approaches. Our results show that our approach is not only fast, but also finds more reliable composited services.'}

It is desirable for ordinary users to possess a new service selection approach that can recommend satisfactory services to them even when their service selection preferences are specified imprecisely in terms of vagueness, inaccuracy, and incompleteness. This paper proposes a novel service selection approach that resolves the imprecise characteristics of user preferences and can recommend satisfactory services for users with varying cognitive levels in terms of service experience. The proposed service selection approach is comprised of four major tasks: 1) employ user-friendly linguistic variables to collect apparent user preferences (AUP) and convert the linguistic variables to standardized fuzzy weights as AUP weights; 2) evaluate all users' respective cognitive levels for the target service type and obtain the cognitive level threshold for that type of services; 3) adjust the AUP weights based on the calculated cognitive levels and the threshold, and supplement the potential user preferences weights; and 4) prioritize candidate services per a user satisfaction maximization objective. In-depth comparative experimental evaluations were performed using two real-world datasets. The results show that our service selection model outperforms three other representative ones and could provide a stable and reliable selection of services for the users with low service cognitive levels."}

Failures of virtual machines (VMs) in clouds have caused serious quality assurance issues for those services. VM replication is a commonly used technique for enhancing the reliability of cloud services. However, when determining the VM redundancy strategy for a specific service, many state-of-the-art methods ignore the huge network resource consumption issue that could be experienced when the service is in failure recovery mode. This paper proposes a redundant VM placement optimization approach to enhancing the reliability of cloud services. The approach employs three algorithms. The first algorithm selects an appropriate set of VM-hosting servers from a potentially large set of candidate host servers based upon the network topology. The second algorithm determines an optimal strategy to place the primary and backup VMs on the selected host servers with k-fault-tolerance assurance. Lastly, a heuristic is used to address the task-to-VM reassignment optimization problem, which is formulated as finding a maximum weight matching in bipartite graphs. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach outperforms four other representative methods in network resource consumption in the service recovery stage.'}

However, the navigation system (such as GPS navigation system) and apps (such as Waze) may not be possible for each individual user to avoid traffic without creating congestion on the clearer roads, and it might even be that such a recommendation leads to longer aggregate routes. To solve this dispersion, in this paper, we first apply a concept of virtual vehicle in IoV, which is an image of driver and vehicle. Then, we study a setting of non-atomic routing in a network of m parallel links with symmetry of information. While a virtual vehicle knows the cost function associated with links, they are known to the individual virtual vehicles choosing the link. The virtual vehicles adapt the cooperation approach via strategic concession game, trying to minimize the individual and total travel time. How much benefit of travel time by the virtual vehicles cooperating when vehicles follow the cooperation decisions? We study the concession ratio: the ratio between the concession equilibrium obtained from an individual optimum and the social optimum. We find that cooperation approach can reduce the efficiency loss compared to the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium. In particular, in the case of two links with affine cost functions, the concession ratio is at most 3/2. For general non-decrease cost functions, the concession ratio is at most 2. For the strategic concession game, the concession ratio can approach to 1 which is a significant improvement over the unbounded price of anarchy.'}

The collaboration reputation is built on a Web service collaboration network consisting of two metrics. One metric, invoking reputation, can be calculated according to other service's recommendation. The other metric, invoked reputation, can be assessed by the interaction frequency among Web services. Finally, based on the collaboration reputation, we present a trustworthy Web service selection method to not only solve the simple Web service selection but also the complex selection.

Traditionally, task rescheduling is used to ensure a consistent quality of service in the event of failure of a virtual machine. However, the network resource consumption of different rescheduling methods varies. To address this problem, we propose a task rescheduling method that minimizes network resource consumption.The method includes three algorithms. The first obtains a set of good virtual machines from the large quantity of service-providing virtual machines using the skyline operation. A ranking algorithm then fuses the data size and the task emergency to identify significant tasks. Finally, we present an algorithm that automatically determines the optimal insertion point for each task. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we extend the renowned simulator CloudSim and conduct a series of experiments. The results show that our method is more efficient than other methods in terms of network resource consumption.'}

Enhancing the reliability of cloud service has become a critical and challenging research problem. In the cloud computing environment, all resources are commercialized. Therefore, a reliability enhancement approach should not consume too much resource. However, existing approaches cannot achieve the optimal effect because of checkpoint image-sharing neglect, and checkpoint image inaccessibility caused by node crashing. To address this problem, we propose a cloud service reliability enhancement approach for minimizing network and storage resource usage in a cloud data center. In our proposed approach, the identical parts of all virtual machines that provide the same service are checkpointed once as the service checkpoint image, which can be shared by those virtual machines to reduce the storage resource consumption. Then, the remaining checkpoint images only save the modified page. To persistently store the checkpoint image, the checkpoint image storage problem is modeled as an optimization problem. Finally, we present an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm exploits the data center network architecture characteristics and the node failure predicator to minimize network resource usage. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we extend the renowned cloud simulator Cloudsim and conduct experiments on it. Experimental results based on the extended Cloudsim show that the proposed approach not only guarantees cloud service reliability, but also consumes fewer network and storage resources than other approaches.'}

In NCDCs, tens of thousands of virtual machines (VMs) are assigned to physical servers to provide data-intensive services with a quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee, and consume a massive amount of energy in the process. Although many VM placement schemes have been proposed to solve this problem of energy consumption, most of these assume that all the physical servers are homogeneous. However, the physical server configurations of NCDCs often differ significantly, which leads to varying energy consumption characteristics. In this paper, we explore an alternative VM placement approach to minimize energy consumption during the provision of data-intensive services with a global QoS guarantee in NCDCs. We use an improved particle swarm optimization algorithm to develop an optimal VM placement approach involving a tradeoff between energy consumption and global QoS guarantee for data-intensive services. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms other approaches to energy optimization and global QoS guarantee in NCDCs.'}

In this article, we study the relationship between user context and feedback ratings according to which one user often gives different feedback ratings to the same multimedia service in different user contexts. We further propose an enhanced user context-aware reputation-measurement approach for multimedia services that is accurate in two senses: (1) Each multimedia service has three reputation values with three different user context levels when its feedback ratings are sufficient and (2) the reputation of a multimedia service with different user context levels is found using user context sensitivity and user similarity when its feedback ratings are limited or not available.

Generally, some QoS values of a service are unknown to its users who has never invoked it before, and therefore the accurate prediction of unknown QoS values is significant for the successful deployment of web service-based applications. Collaborative filtering is an important method for predicting missing values, and has thus been widely adopted in the prediction of unknown QoS values. However, collaborative filtering originated from the processing of subjective data, such as movie scores. The QoS data of web services are usually objective, meaning that existing collaborative filtering-based approaches are not always applicable for unknown QoS values. Based on real world web service QoS data and a number of experiments, in this paper, we determine some important characteristics of objective QoS datasets that have never been found before. We propose a prediction algorithm to realize these characteristics, allowing the unknown QoS values to be predicted accurately. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm predicts unknown web service QoS values more accurately than other existing approaches.'}

This method includes the following steps: first, to collect and standardize the real-time information describing the network and the video, then to assess the video quality and calculate the video coding rate based on the standardized information, and then to process the encoded compression of the video according to the calculated coding rate and transfer the compressed video.

Avoiding recommending dishonest or unsatisfactory services is a fundamental research problem in the design of web service recommendation systems. Reputation of web services is a widely-employed metric that determines whether the service should be recommended to a user. The service reputation score is usually calculated using feedback ratings provided by users. Although the reputation measurement of web service has been studied in the recent literature, existing malicious and subjective user feedback ratings often lead to a bias that degrades the performance of the service recommendation system. In this paper, we propose a novel reputation measurement approach for web service recommendations. We first detect malicious feedback ratings by adopting the cumulative sum control chart, and then we reduce the effect of subjective user feedback preferences employing the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. Moreover, in order to defend malicious feedback ratings, we propose a malicious feedback rating prevention scheme employing Bloom filtering to enhance the recommendation performance. Extensive experiments are conducted by employing a real feedback rating data set with 1.5 million web service invocation records. The experimental results show that our proposed measurement approach can reduce the deviation of the reputation measurement and enhance the success ratio of the web service recommendation.'}

The approach maps each Web service into virtual space to distribute all QoS attributes among P2P nodes, and then designs a distributed decision tree to support range service query with QoS requirements. Finally, a load balance algorithm is used to reduce range query cost. Experimental results based on synthetic and real datasets show our proposed approach can perform effective service discovery with low cost in P2P environments.'}

The results of this survey study, conducted with 223 Chinese employees located in 30 provincial areas, show that work hour only predicted emotional exhaustion. Neither emotional exhaustion nor procrastination at work was predicted by income. Screen time on mobile phone predicted procrastination. By contrast, time perspective predicted both. The findings suggest that work hour can work as resources when it is appraised as supporting personal growth and development, whereas income was not necessarily appraised as supportive of personal development. Additionally, a theoretical perspective of imbalance between effort and reward explained job burnout and procrastination better than their independent effects. Theoretical framework for promoting off-task activities based on context-aware persuasion was proposed. Finally, informed by the philosophy of socio-technical design, this study called for a holistic and collective-oriented perspective to design technical systems for employee.\nKeywordsJob burnoutProcrastination at workWork hourTime perspectiveIncomeJob demands-resources modelContext-aware persuasion'}

These issues are mainly seen at two levels: (1) on discourses surrounding motivations and value of HCI as a sociotechnical field, and (2) on discourses surrounding concepts of HCI diffusion, maturity and diversity as articulated by global and local knowledge networks. Since the beginning of HCI, discussions of democracy have been around. It may even be fair to say that the key notion of usability aims to support the citizens of a democratic society. Obviously, exactly how HCI should do this remains open for discussion. HCI has several roots deep in military needs from the world wars of the 20th century. It was also born out of the sociotechnical traditions with its emancipatory ambitions, aiming at creating conditions for supporting human agency that facilitates the realization of people’s needs and potential. There’s an inherent contradiction between these traditions. Thus, we’re interested in exploring the following question: how to reconcile such diverse discourses as military power and emancipatory ambitions in a geopolitical analysis of HCI research and associated discourses? Moreover, the diffusion of HCI as field of knowledge and practice is dominated by political and post-colonial discourses that pervade local and global knowledge networks shaping what is considered useful and relevant research and practice. In this workshop we understand these issues as geopolitical in nature and aim to trace the cultural and sociotechnical dynamics that construct the field of HCI.KeywordsGeopolitical issuesSociotechnicalHCI knowledgeHCI practiceDiffusionMaturityDiversity'}

A different dynamic cost model (DDCM) for each sharable frequency slot (FS) is proposed with the consideration of the flexibility and integrity of VON request.

We provide a theoretical underpinning for the application of p-poly structure in providing protection against multi-link failures. Two greedy algorithms and two ant colony optimization algorithms are respectively proposed for constructing p-poly structure in static and dynamic networks.

Since using these VMs has a cost depending on utilization time, a complex problem of VNF placement and scheduling (VPS) must be addressed to achieve satisfactory network performance (e.g., latency) while minimizing the cost paid to lease VMs. In this study, a cost-efficient VPS scheme (CE-VPS) is proposed to address the VPS problem in public cloud networks considering dynamic requests of ordered sequences of VNFs. Our CE-VPS scheme goes beyond existing solutions as it models some important practical aspects such as an additional latency incurred by booting a VM and installing a VNF instance. Also, CE-VPS considers that VNFs can be multi-threaded or single-threaded, and that their throughput as a function of allocated computing resources must be modeled differently.

Moreover, certain HPC application always shows some specific communication patterns, and different topologies have various performances with these patterns. To implement a traffic pattern adaptive HPC system, we propose a topology reconfigurable hybrid network architecture based on optical circuit switching (OCS), which could be adjusted into different classical topologies. And an algorithm of topology calculating and a permutation matrix-based optical switch configuration mechanism are proposed to construct network. We discuss network performances with limited OCS switches occupation, and results show that traffic pattern adaptive network improves the performance of latency and throughput to a large extent.'}

However, conventional single light-tree based multicast provisioning schemes are spectrum inefficient with low modulation level employed. Since a multicast service can be hosted in multiple geographically-distributed datacenters in an elastic optical datacenter network (EODN), we construct several distributed sub-light-trees (DSLTs) to serve the users of a multicast request. Further, we protect each source-destination pair of a primary DSLT by a link-disjoint backup path against any link failure. Spectrum resource can be shared among the backup paths of different multicast requests (i.e., cross-sharing) or among the primary paths and the backup paths of the same multicast request (i.e., self-sharing) if they do not fail simultaneously. To formulate such a problem, an Integer Linear Program (ILP) is developed for a static traffic scenario. We also propose an efficient heuristic approach for the dynamic traffic scenario. Numerical results show that the proposed DSLT-based multicast provisioning with shared protection scheme outperforms conventional survivable multicast provisioning schemes based on single light-tree with or without shared protection in terms of spectrum efficiency and blocking probability.'}

As chip multiprocessors (CMPs) scale to unprecedented numbers of cores, the performance of next-generation CMPs will be bounded by the process yield and power density of single chip. In earlier work we proposed a multi-chip ONoC architecture that scales to large numbers of CMPs and delivers high performance in terms of delay and throughout. Building on that work, in this paper we propose an optimized architecture for integrating a large number of cores into chips with a novel control strategy, including a contention resolution scheme and a resource reservation scheme. The proposed control strategy is crucial to large scale ONoCs, because the resource reservation scheme ensures efficient wavelength allocation for the traffic while the contention management scheme is effective in reducing the impact of contentions. To sustain good performance and energy efficiency of large-scale ONoC, the topology is optimized to reduce the average transmission distance with minimum increase of power consumption. We evaluate the proposed architecture within a 1000-core processor system and compare it with CMesh and several previously proposed topologies with different control strategies. The simulation results show that, our new large-scale architecture can achieve better performance on throughput and delay.'}

Based on this concept, the k-node (edge) content connected elastic optical data center network (KC-EODCN) has been defined. To realize the KC-EODCN, individually establishing k independent end-to-content paths for each user is a direct method with lower complexity. However, this method ignores the relevance among the users who request the same level of k-node (edge) content connectivity and causes more spectrum consumption. In this paper, a survivable k-node (edge) content connected virtual optical network (KC-VON) is defined. The users who require the same level of k-node (edge) content connectivity are organized into one KC-VON. The KC-VON satisfies the k-node (edge) content connectivity requirement that each user has at least k virtual independent end-to-content paths. The KC-VON embedding scheme is proposed instead of individually establishing k independent end-to-content paths for each user. Moreover, the KC-VON construction algorithm is developed to realize the KC-VON's construction. An integer linear program model and heuristic KC-VON embedding algorithms are developed to realize the virtual link mapping.

Traditional satellite resource allocation scheme aiming at maximizing throughput can lead to unfair transmission rates between rescue teams, which further causes delayed rescue. However, there is a conflict between optimizing throughput and ensuring fairness. In this paper, we propose a satellite channel model corresponding to post-earthquake communication scenarios. Then we propose a joint power and bandwidth allocation scheme to maximize the throughput of the satellite, which considers fairness based on the channel model. The problem is difficult to solve due to the nonconvex objective function and complicated equality constraints. To solve the problem, we transform the original problem into an equivalent problem by introducing an auxiliary variable firstly. Secondly, we propose an algorithm to solve the equivalent problem by applying successive convex optimization techniques. Finally, we verify the fairness and convergence of the algorithm through simulations. Different traffic demands are set in the simulation, so the fairness of the transmission rate is reflected in the transmission time. The maximum transmission time of the proposed scheme is much less than the traditional scheme in simulations.'}

To maximize the system uplink throughput, the UAV altitude, power control, as well as the bandwidth allocation between the access and backhaul links are jointly optimized. Especially, the constraint for the uplink rate fairness is also considered. Our formulated problem is nonconvex due to the complex uplink co-channel interference under the Line-of-Sight (LoS) probability-based Air-to-Ground (AtG) channel. To tackle this issue, we change our formulated problem into an equivalent form by coping with the information-causality and fairness constraints. Then, a joint altitude and resource allocation (JARA) algorithm is developed, which iteratively solves the altitude optimization subproblem and resource optimization subproblem until convergence. For each subproblem, we further introduce auxiliary variables so that it can be solved by using the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Finally, two benchmarks are used for the throughput comparison, and simulation results verify that the system uplink throughput of our proposed algorithm is improved through the AtG LoS propagation advantage, uplink power control, as well as the bandwidth allocation between the access and backhaul links.'}

The outdoor transmission model and outdoor–indoor transmission model cannot be normalized, and an effective hybrid transmission model is difficult to establish when the UAV serves both indoor users and outdoor users. We propose a ”indoor-outdoor-iterative optimization” (IOI) coverage scheme that does not require the establishment of a hybrid transmission model, that is, covering indoor users first, then outdoor users, and finally iterative optimization. When the outdoor user’s location information is unknown, the user’s required bandwidth and power cannot be accurately calculated. In order to obtain the location information of outdoor users, we propose a method to estimate outdoor user distribution (MEUD) by using user density. We further estimate the transmit power of all users, and greatly reduce the calculation amount. Simulation results show that the greater the user density, the closer the estimated value is to the accurate value. By user’s distribution, we propose a scheme based on 3D location, power and bandwidth allocation, which can maximize the coverage of indoor users and outdoor users and ensure the fairness of all users.

The feasibility of the scheme is discussed in three cases, and specific algorithms are given respectively. Finally, we give a comprehensive algorithm based on three cases. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the algorithm and ensure that the gap in communication rate between users of MEUD is less than 0.5%.'}

Invoking NOMA in heterogeneous networks (HetNets) can support ubiquitous connectivity and satisfy the growing demand for mobile data traffic. Existing studies on NOMA-enhanced HetNets mainly focus on network’s quality of service (QoS) metrics such as delay, throughput, coverage, etc. However, these parameters are not sufficient for evaluating the quality of experience (QoE) perceived by users. To that end, we propose a QoE-aware resource allocation framework for NOMA-enhanced HetNets under Web browsing and video services. Specifically, a unified QoE-aware joint subchannel and power allocation optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum mean opinion scores (MOSs) of all users, while guaranteeing the QoE requirement of each user. However, this problem is mixed-integer, non-convex, and intractable. To solve it, a penalty-based iterative algorithm is proposed. In particular, binary constraints on subchannel assignment variables are equivalently transformed into equality constraints via penalty method. Then, subchannel assignment and power allocation are alternately optimized in each iteration by leveraging block coordinate descent method and sequential parametric convex approximation techniques. Extensive numerical results show that the proposed scheme could achieve competitive QoE performance compared to existing NOMA and orthogonal multiple access schemes.'}

The system reliability is usually constrained under limited bandwidth and power resources. Downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can improve the system reliability through a higher resource utilization. To this end, we introduce downlink NOMA to a UAV-enabled mobile relaying system and investigate a scenario where a fixed-wing UAV flies in a circular trajectory to serve as a mobile decode-and-forward (DF) relay in an emergency situation. Since guaranteeing a reliable link is necessary in an emergency situation, our formulated problem is to minimize the maximum outage probability among all links, taking into account the bandwidth and power allocations based on downlink NOMA. Specially, the condition for successful successive interference cancellation (SIC) is also considered. By making change of variables and introducing slack variables, we reformulate our problem into a more tractable form, then we propose an iteration algorithm to solve our problem based on the successive convex optimization (SCO) technique. The optimized bandwidth and power allocation schemes as well as the min-max outage probability along the UAV trajectory are obtained, respectively. Two benchmarks are designed to reveal the performance of our proposed algorithm, and the reliability gain can be obtained by comparing the min-max outage probability and the overall average outage probability.'}

However, existing 1- dimensional (1-D) Markov chain models of 802.11p systems are unable to capture the complete QoS performance and queuing behavior due to the lack of an adequate finite buffer model. We present a 2-dimensional (2-D) Markov chain that integrates the broadcast scheme of the 802.11p system and the queuing process into one model. The extra dimension, which models the queue length, allows us to accurately capture the important QoS measures, delay and loss, plus throughput and queue length, for realistic 802.11p systems with finite buffer under finite load. We derive a simplified method to solve the steady state probabilities of the 2-D Markov chain. Our 2-D Markov chain model is the first finite buffer model defined and solved for the broadcast scheme of 802.11p systems. The 2-D model solutions are validated by extensive simulations. Our analyses reveal that the lack of binary exponential backoff and retransmission in the 802.11p system results in poor QoS performance during heavy traffic load, particularly for large VANETs. We demonstrate that our model provides traffic control guidelines to maintain good QoS performance for VANETs.'}

In the meantime, energy efficiency (EE) has now become a critical metric for green system design. In this paper, energy-efficient and fair resource allocation is investigated in a downlink OFDM-based mobile communication system. Given a subcarrier assignment, the bisection-based optimal power allocation (BOPA) is proposed at first, which achieves the maximum EE and guarantees proportional data rates for users. Then, a two-step subcarrier assignment is designed to avoid unaffordable computational complexity of exhaustive search. In the first step, the estimated energy-efficient transmit power is found via the assumptions on flat fading and subcarrier sharing. In the second step, the traditional spectral-efficient subcarrier assignment (SESA) is introduced to complete the bandwidth resource allocation among users. Although the two-step subcarrier assignment is suboptimal due to the fact that the optimization is done independently in two separate steps, numerical results demonstrate that its performance is very close to the optimum. This paper also studies the difference between the energy-efficient solution and the traditional spectral-efficient policy and observes that they are similar with each other in the low channel-gain-to-noise ratio (CNR) regime. This observation is helpful and could enable that the energy-efficient design can be turned into the relatively simpler spectral-efficient policy when the CNR is low.'}

We first study the generalized MIMO Y channel model with general signal demands; then, the degrees of freedom (DoF) achieved are given and are proved using SSA. Although SSA could decrease the number of antennas at the relay, it places new restrictions on the numbers of antennas at the nodes. We then introduce a method to compare the models with and without SSA network coding (SSA-NC), mainly from the perspective of the total number of antennas used. The results show that if each node must be able to exchange signals with all others, the model with SSA will definitely use more antennas to supply the same DoF, when K > 5. If it is not necessary for every node to exchange signals with all others, the comparison can still be made by using the method introduced here. As a result, the conditions under which SSA-NC is needed are presented.'}

Systems based on log-distance path loss model suffer from the multi-path problem and the adjustment of Wi-Fi station powers, and achieve low accuracy in complex environments. The appearance of fine time measurement protocol supported Wi-Fi access points provide a novel way to develop accurate indoor positioning algorithms. Considering the influence of the indoor multi-path effect to the fine time measurement ranging accuracy, we propose a multi-dimensional scaling based positioning algorithm to reduce the impact of ranging errors. We leverage the multidimensional scaling algorithm to estimate the rough position of positioning clients. Successively, adjusting the weight of fine time measurement ranging, we optimize the positioning results with the application of a SMACOF strategy.

Most existing methods on human motion mode recognition assume that all sensors are mounted in a fixed position on users' body while walking. However, it is inconvenient for a user to mount his/her phone in a specific position. When a user holds his/her phone in hand, the situation becomes fairly complex. First, the motion of the hand is coupled with the general activity of the user. Second, the characteristics of the inertial sensors may vary along with diverse carrying modes. In this paper, eight different human activities are defined to characterize the phone holding modes and the motion patterns. By extracting features in time and frequency domains from the tri-axis accelerometer and tri-axis gyroscope signals, we design and implement a hierarchical classification system to detect complex walking patterns based on the decision tree, random forest and hidden Markov model (HMM). Simulation experimental results demonstrate that the recognition success of complex walking pattern using the proposed method is more than 93.8% for eight complex motion modes."}

In this paper, a pervasive indoor and outdoor scenario identification algorithm is proposed, which utilizes both the sensing data collected by the commodity smartphones and recognized human activity information. The indoor and outdoor scenario identification is modelled as a binary classification problem. To better utilize the collected sensor data and inferred human activities, two time-dependent Adaboost classifiers are developed to perform stateless and instance-based scene detection. The stateless detection result is further used as the observation of a hidden Markov model (HMM) to obtain the final scene estimation. The adoption of the stateful HMM filter can effectively eliminate the occasional noises and improve detection accuracy. Furthermore, to meet the high-accuracy detection demand on the indoor-outdoor transition scenario, invoking GPGSV on demand is introduced to improve the detection confidence.

The main challenge emerges when the complexity of Wi-Fi signals on the same floor exceeds the complexity between the floors along the vertical direction, leading to a reduced floor distinguishability. A second challenge regards the complexity of Wi-Fi features in environments with atrium, hollow areas, mezzanines, intermediate floors, and crowded signal channels. In this article, we propose an adaptive Wi-Fi-based floor identification algorithm to achieve accurate floor identification also in these environments. Our algorithm, based on the Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator and spatial similarity, first identifies autonomous blocks parcelling the whole environment. Then, local floor identification is performed through the proposed Wi-Fi models to fully harness the Wi-Fi features. Finally, floors are estimated through the joint optimization of the autonomous blocks and the local floor models. We have conducted extensive experiments in three real large and multistorey buildings greater than 140 000 m\n2^2\n using 19 different devices. Finally, we show a comparison between our proposal and other state-of-the-art algorithms. Experimental results confirm that our proposal performs better than other methods, and it exhibits an average accuracy of 97.24%.'}

However, compass directions indoor are heavily distorted due to the presence of ferromagnetic materials. Conventional particle filters convert the raw compass direction to a distribution adding a constant variance noise and leveraging a particle swarm to simulate the distribution. Finally, the selection of eligible directions is performed applying external constraints mainly imposed from the indoor map. However, the choice of a constant parameter decreases the positioning performances because the variance of nearby context, including topography, ferromagnetic materials, and particle distribution, is not represented. Therefore, we propose the particle filter reinforcement able to adaptively learn and adjust the variance of the direction observing the context in real-time. Experiments in real-world scenarios show that the proposed method improves the positioning accuracy by more than 20% at the 80% probability compared with state-of-the-art methods.'}

This article introduces a robust positioning method that leverages the constraints of multiple positioning nodes at different positions. We transfer a sequence of temporal ranging measurements into multiple virtual positioning clients (VPCs) in the spatial domain by considering their spatial constraints. Defining an objective function and the spatial constraints of the VPCs as Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, we solve the positioning estimation with nonconvex optimization. We propose an iterative weight estimation method for the time of flight ranging and the VPC to optimize the positioning model.

Wi-Fi signals can provide rough initial positions, and magnetic fields can further improve the positioning accuracies, therefore many researchers have tried to combine the two signals for high-accuracy indoor localization. Currently, state-of-the-art solutions design separate algorithms to process different indoor signals. Outputs of these algorithms are generally used as inputs of data fusion strategies. These methods rely on computationally expensive particle filters, labor-intensive feature analysis, and time-consuming parameter tuning to achieve better accuracies. Besides, particle filters need to estimate the moving directions of particles, limiting smartphone orientation to be stable, and aligned with the user's moving directions. In this paper, we adopted a convolutional neural network (CNN) to implement an accurate and orientation-free positioning system. Inspired by the state-of-the-art image classification methods, we design a novel hybrid location image using Wi-Fi and magnetic field fingerprints, and then a CNN is employed to classify the locations of the fingerprint images. In order to prevent the overfitting problem of the positioning CNN on limited training datasets, we also propose to divide the learning process into two steps to adopt proper learning strategies for different network branches. We show that the CNN solution is able to automatically learn location patterns, thus significantly lower the workforce burden of designing a localization system. Our experimental results convincingly reveal that the proposed positioning method achieves an accuracy of about 1 m under different smartphone orientations, users, and use patterns."}

Crowdsourced software development has provided a new method for the software industry to produce quality software based on an open-call format. Selecting an appropriate task to develop (developer-end) or evaluate (platform-end) is one of the primary problems in this type of open-call format. Receiving or assigning an improper task to an improper crowdsource (CS) developer does not only decrease the quality of the software deliverables, but also causes overburden on both the platform and the developers. To solve this problem, sorting the tasks based on the developers' human characteristics may increase task relevancy for developers, which can accelerate efficiency and lessen complexity. Thus, this paper has conducted an empirical experiment to measure the influence of personality on task selection based on the important characteristics of a task: money, time, and type. A total of 83 students from the University of Sindh voluntarily participated in four different short-duration rounds of task development using the developed CS platform. The personality types of the participants were measured based on the Myers-Briggs type indicator. In addition, a complex network technique called weighted degree centrality was applied to identify the most suitable personality for task sorting based on money or complexity attractions (i.e., time or type). Based on the results, it can be observed that personality has a significant relationship with task selection. For instance, developers with intuitive (N) and feeling (F) personality traits are primarily focused on the time duration of a project."}

However, the existing deep learning models are mainly designed for short texts matching and cannot be directly applied to the search of scientific papers. The main reason is that the differences between long and short texts in scientific paper search have not been fully considered, and the structural information of the text will be lost when the length difference is large. In order to solve the above long-short scientific text matching problem, we propose a multi-view relevance matching model (MVRM) of scientific papers based on graph convolutional network and attention mechanism. First, we use scientific papers abstract to construct interactive graph to retain the structural information in the long text. Each vertex denotes the keyword in the abstract and the edge weight denotes similarity between the keywords. Second, we propose a matching network for interactive graph based on the graph convolution networks. Multiple keywords in the search term form multiple views, and each keyword under each view interacts with the interactive graph. Then the interaction feature vectors from multiple views are generated through graph convolution network. Finally, attention mechanism is used for fusion, and the final matching result is output through the multilayer perceptron. Experiments on several representative scientific paper search datasets demonstrate that our model achieves better performance.KeywordsRelevance matchingGraph convolutional networkAttention mechanismMulti-viewLong-short text matching'}

The category of the paper has a hierarchical structure, so the paper classification can be converted into a hierarchical classification problem. However, the existing methods cannot effectively classify papers due to the following two reasons: First, these methods cannot well capture the semantic relationship between papers. Second, they neglect to model the hierarchical structure of labels. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical label attention model based on graph attention network, which utilizes word co-occurrence to model the semantic relationship of papers. We use multiple linear layers to model the category hierarchy and combine every hierarchy of labels through an attention mechanism.

We adopt Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BGRU) and attention mechanism to capture the long-term dependence of data on time series. The attention mechanism is used to analyze the weight of the impact of data from different time periods on the trend prediction results, thereby reducing the error of stock data change trend prediction and improving the accuracy of trend prediction. We select the daily closing price data of 10 stocks for model training and performance evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method STPA achieves higher precision, recall rate and F1-Score in predicting stock change trends than the other methods.

The pavement with high IRI not only reduces the lifetime of vehicles, but also raises the risk of car accidents. Accurate prediction of IRI becomes a key task for the pavement management system, and it helps the transportation department refurbish the pavement in time. However, existing models are proposed on top of small datasets, and have poor performance. Besides, they only consider cross-sectional features of the pavements without any time-series information.

Previous event-participant arrangement studies either fail to avoid conflicts among events or ignore the social interactions among participants. In this work, we propose a new event-participant arrangement problem called Interaction-aware Global Event-Participant Arrangement (IGEPA). It globally optimizes arrangements between events and participants to avoid conflicts in events, and not only accounts for user interests, but also encourages socially active participants to join.

To solve the problems of feature heterogeneity and semantic gap of different media data, existing deep cross-media quantization technology provides an efficient and effective solution for cross-media common semantic representation learning. However, due to the fact that social network data often exhibits semantic sparsity, diversity, and contains a lot of noise, the performance of existing cross-media search methods often degrades. To address the above issue, this paper proposes a novel fine-grained cross-media representation learning model with deep quantization attention network for social network cross-media search (CMSL). First, we construct the image-word semantic correlation graph, and perform deep random walks on the graph to realize semantic expansion and semantic embedding learning, which can discover some potential semantic correlations between images and words. Then, in order to discover more fine-grained cross-media semantic correlations, a multi-scale fine-grained cross-media semantic correlation learning method that combines global and local saliency semantic similarity is proposed. Third, the fine-grained cross-media representation, cross-media semantic correlations and binary quantization code are jointly learned by a unified deep quantization attention network, which can preserve both inter-media correlations and intra-media similarities, by minimizing both cross-media correlation loss and binary quantization loss. Experimental results demonstrate that CMSL can generate high-quality cross-media common semantic representation, which yields state-of-the-art cross-media search performance on two benchmark datasets, NUS-WIDE and MIR-Flickr 25k.\n\t'}

In this paper, we present a novel database, RAF-DB, which contains about 30000 facial images from thousands of individuals. Each image has been individually labeled about 40 times, then EM algorithm was used to filter out unreliable labels. Crowdsourcing reveals that real-world faces often express compound emotions, or even mixture ones. For all we know, RAF-DB is the first database that contains compound expressions in the wild. Our cross-database study shows that the action units of basic emotions in RAF-DB are much more diverse than, or even deviate from, those of lab-controlled ones. To address this problem, we propose a new DLP-CNN (Deep Locality-Preserving CNN) method, which aims to enhance the discriminative power of deep features by preserving the locality closeness while maximizing the inter-class scatters. The benchmark experiments on the 7-class basic expressions and 11-class compound expressions, as well as the additional experiments on SFEW and CK+ databases, show that the proposed DLP-CNN outperforms the state-of-the-art handcrafted features and deep learning based methods for the expression recognition in the wild.'}

Taking advantage of the strong fitting ability of the convolutional neural network for the nonlinear relationship, this algorithm utilizes the learned reconstruction parameters to pad missing structures and make the low-resolution video approach to the ground truth. However, it is unavoidable to introduce irrelevant information and amplify noises in this process. The patch similarity is imported to improve the spatial-temporal consistency and anti-noise ability of this algorithm. Moreover, instead of considering the nonlocal self-similarity only, this algorithm combines the nonlocal external sparsity and spatial-temporal similarity to enrich the prior information. All these patch similarities are used to optimize the intermediate video achieved from the mapping process.

Considering that the brightness dynamic range is an important factor which greatly influences the image visual effect and its rich information contents, we improve the image brightness by the brightness enhancement algorithm for the low-exposure images. By combining the exposure value detecting and the brightness enhancement, it could improve the time efficiency and the block matching accuracy for the high dynamic range reconstruction algorithm based on MBDS, and also the artifacts and shake phenomenon produced in the reconstruction process could be reduced. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model could achieve better exposure compensation, which obtains more reasonable image brightness and much richer image details information.'}

Extensive experiments conducted on various attributed networks datasets demonstrate that LADSL is superior to the other methods on few-shot node classification task.'}

In this paper, we propose Seq2Seq-RE, an end-to-end relation extraction model, which first utilizes the gate graph neural networks (GGNNs) for joint extraction of entities and relations. Unlike previous works, we take the interaction of entities and relations through a GGNNs-based sequence-to-sequence with attention mechanism for better extracting multiple relation tuples. Besides, our graph structure based on the forward-edge, backward-edge, self-edge, and dependency-edge. To our knowledge, we are the first to employ four types of edge into graph-based neural networks for joint extraction of entities and relations and conduct a comprehensive qualitative analysis to investigate what types of edges benefit our task.

As a result, the RNN is spatial-aware and can implicitly model the deblurring process with spatially varying kernels. To better exploit properties of the spatially varying RNN, we develop both one-dimensional and two-dimensional RNNs for deblurring. The third component, based on a CNN, reconstructs the final deblurred feature maps into a restored image. In addition, the whole network is end-to-end trainable. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art deblurring algorithms.'}

The video super-resolution reconstruction mechanism with the joint internal and external constraints is established utilizing the complementary advantages of both external deep correlation mapping learning and internal spatio-temporal nonlocal self-similarity prior constraint. A deep learning model based on deep convolutional neural network is constructed to learn the nonlinear correlation mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution video frame patches. A novel spatio-temporal feature similarity calculation method is proposed, which considers both internal video spatio-temporal self-similarity and external clean nonlocal similarity. For the internal spatio-temporal feature self-similarity, we improve the accuracy and robustness of similarity matching by proposing a similarity measure strategy based on spatio-temporal moment feature similarity and structural similarity. The external nonlocal similarity prior constraint is learned by the patch group-based Gaussian mixture model. The time efficiency for spatio-temporal similarity matching is further improved based on saliency detection and region correlation judgment strategy, which achieves a better tradeoff between super-resolution accuracy and speed. Experimental results demonstrate that the DLSS-VSR algorithm achieves competitive super-resolution quality compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms in both subjective and objective evaluations.'}

Cross-media scientific and\ntechnological information retrieval obtain target information from massive\nmulti-source and heterogeneous scientific and technological resources, which\nhelps to design applications that meet users' needs, including scientific and\ntechnological information recommendation, personalized scientific and\ntechnological information retrieval, etc. The core of cross-media retrieval is\nto learn a common subspace, so that data from different media can be directly\ncompared with each other after being mapped into this subspace. In subspace\nlearning, existing methods often focus on modeling the discrimination of\nintra-media data and the invariance of inter-media data after mapping; however,\nthey ignore the semantic consistency of inter-media data before and after\nmapping and media discrimination of intra-semantics data, which limit the\nresult of cross-media retrieval.

Due to the complexity of the\nsecond-order random walk models and memory limitations, it is not scalable to\nrun second-order random walk-based applications on a single machine.

These improved loss functions share the similar idea for maximizing inter-class variance or minimizing intra-class variance. In this article, from a different perspective, we consider enlarging the inter-class variance by directly penalizing weight vectors of last fully connected layer, which represent the center of classes. To the end, we propose Orthogonality loss as an elegant penalty item appends to common classification loss to learn the discriminative representations. The main idea is that in order for weight vectors to be discriminative, it should be as close as possible to be orthogonal to each other in the vector space. More specifically, the optimization objective of Orthogonality loss is the first moment and second moment of cosine similarity of weight vectors. We performed the empirical studies through simulating the long-tail datasets to show the generalization ability of the proposed approach on long-tail distribution datasets. Further, extensive experiments on large-scale face recognition benchmarks including the Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW), the IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A), IJB-B, IJB-C, MegaFace Challenge 1 (MF1) and MS-Celeb-1M Low-shot Learning demonstrated that Orthogonality loss outperforms strong baselines, which showcases the extensive suitability and effectiveness of Orthogonality loss.'}

Unfortunately, the randomness and semantic sparsity of the social network text bring significant challenges to the event detection task. In addition to text, time is another vital element in reflecting events since events are often followed for a while. Therefore, in this article, we propose a novel method named Multi-View Graph Attention Network (MVGAN) for event detection in social networks. It enriches event semantics through both neighbor aggregation and multi-view fusion in a heterogeneous social event graph. Specifically, we first construct a heterogeneous graph by adding the hashtag to associate the isolated short texts and describe events comprehensively. Then, we learn view-specific representations of events through graph convolutional networks from the perspectives of text semantics and time distribution, respectively. Finally, we design a hashtag-based multi-view graph attention mechanism to capture the intrinsic interaction across different views and integrate the feature representations to discover events. Extensive experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that MVGAN performs favorably against many state-of-the-art social network event detection algorithms. It also proves that more meaningful signals can contribute to improving the event detection effect in social networks, such as published time and hashtags.'}

Latent factor models have been widely used for recommendation. Most existing latent factor models mainly utilize the interaction information between users and items, although some recently extended models utilize some auxiliary information to learn a unified latent factor for users and items. The unified latent factor only represents the characteristics of users and the properties of items from the aspect of purchase history. However, the characteristics of users and the properties of items may stem from different aspects, e.g., the brand-aspect and category-aspect of items. Moreover, the latent factor models usually use the shallow projection, which cannot capture the characteristics of users and items well. Deep neural network has shown tremendous potential to model the non-linearity relationship between users and items. It can be used to replace shallow projection to model the complex correlation between users and items. In this paper, we propose a Neural network based Aspect-level Collaborative Filtering model (NeuACF) to exploit different aspect latent factors. Through modelling the rich object properties and relations in recommender system as a heterogeneous information network, NeuACF first extracts different aspect-level similarity matrices of users and items, respectively, through different meta-paths, and then feeds an elaborately designed deep neural network with these matrices to learn aspect-level latent factors. Finally, the aspect-level latent factors are fused for the top-N recommendation. Moreover, to fuse information from different aspects more effectively, we further propose NeuACF++ to fuse aspect-level latent factors with self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on three real world datasets show that NeuACF and NeuACF++ significantly outperform both existing latent factor models and recent neural network models.'}

As the texts of social media messages are usually so short, when traditional existing document modeling methods are used in social network search tasks, the problem of semantic sparsity arises, leading to low-quality semantic representation and low-precision social network search results. Fortunately, besides of short text, social media data also has other features, such as timestamps, locations, and its user information. In light of this, to realize precise social network search, we propose a multi-feature probabilistic graphical model (MFPGM), which can generate high-quality semantic representation. To deal with the problem of semantic sparsity, we exploit two strategies in MFPGM. First, we propose a concept named special region and utilize location information to aggregate short text into long text. Second, we introduce the biterm pattern that can generate dense semantic space by supposing that a biterm occurring in the same context has the same topic. In order to generate high-quality semantic representations, we simultaneously model multiple features (i.e., biterm, user, location and timestamp) of social network data to enhance the semantic learning process of MFPGM. We conduct a lot of experiments on real-word datasets, and the comparisons with several state-of-art baseline methods have demonstrated the superiority of our MFPGM on topic quality and search performance. Additionally, with the help of the generated semantic representations, MFPGM allows people to analyze the relationships between time and the popularities of topics.'}

In this paper, we propose a new multi-view clustering method that integrates deep matrix factorization, low-rank subspace learning, and multiple subspace ensemble in a unified framework, which we term as the Deep Low-Rank Subspace Ensemble (DLRSE) method. DLRSE first employs deep matrix factorization to capture diverse and hierarchical structures in data for robust multi-view multi-layer data representations. Then, low-rank subspace representations are learned from the extracted factors to further reveal their correlations, from which more explicit clustering structure can be obtained. We further develop a subspace ensemble learning method with structured sparsity regularization to aggregate different subspaces into a consensus subspace, which can incorporate the intrinsic clustering structure across multiple views better. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively explore the diversified clustering structure inherent in data and exploit multi-view complementary information, and achieve considerable improvement in performance over existing methods.'}

Because social network topics change quickly, developing an effective method to model such topics is urgently needed. However, topic modeling is challenging due to the sparsity problem and the dynamic change of topics in microblog streams. In this study, we propose dynamic topic modeling via a self-aggregation method (SADTM) that can capture the time-varying aspect of topic distributions and resolve the sparsity problem. The SADTM aggregates the observable and unordered short texts as the aggregated document without leveraging an external context to overcome the sparsity problem of short text. Furthermore, we exploit word pairs instead of words for each microblog to generate more word co-occurrence patterns. The SADTM models temporal dynamics by using the topic distribution at previous time steps in microblog streams to infer the current topic from sequential data. Extensive experiments on a real-world Sina microblog dataset demonstrate that our SADTM algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in topic coherence and cluster quality. Additionally, when applied in a search scene, our SADTM significantly outperforms all baseline methods in terms of the quality of the search results.'}

The semantic extension approach learns the meaning of a short text by introducing external knowledge. However, for the randomness of short text descriptions in microblogs, traditional extension methods cannot accurately mine the semantics suitable for the microblog theme. Therefore, we use the prominent and refined hashtag information in microblogs as well as complex social relationships to provide implicit guidance for semantic extension of short text. Specifically, we design a deep hash model based on social and conceptual semantic extension, which consists of dual semantic extension and deep hashing representation. In the extension method, the short text is first conceptualized to achieve the construction of hashtag graph under conceptual space. Then, the associated hashtags are generated by correlation calculation based on the integration of social relationships and concepts to extend the short text. In the deep hash model, we use the semantic hashing model to encode the abundant semantic features and form a compact and meaningful binary encoding. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can learn and represent the short texts well by using more meaningful semantic signal.

In order to make full use of the cross-modal data, we need to establish a common semantic representation to achieve effective measurement and comparison of different modal data. However, due to the heterogeneous distributions of cross-modal data, there exists a semantic gap between them. Although some deep neural network (DNN) based methods have been proposed to deal with this problem, there still exist several challenges: the qualities of the modality-specific features, the structure of the DNN, and the components of the loss function. In this paper, for representing cross-modal data in IoV, we propose a common semantic representation method based on object attention and adversarial learning (OAAL). To acquire high-quality modality-specific feature, in OAAL, we design an object attention mechanism, which links the cross-modal features effectively. To further alleviate the heterogeneous semantic gap, we construct a cross-modal generative adversarial network, which contains two parts: a generative model and a discriminative model. Besides, we also design a comprehensive loss function for the generative model to produce high-quality features. With a minimax game between the two models, we can construct a shared semantic space and generate the unified representations for cross-modal data. Finally, we apply our OAAL on retrieval task, and the results of the experiments have verified its effectiveness.'}

Congestion, stampedes, fights and other tourism emergency events occurred frequently, which should be a wake-up call for tourism security. Therefore, it is of great research value and application prospect to real-time monitor tourists and detect abnormal events in tourism surveillance video by using computer vision and video intelligent processing technology, which can realize the timely forecast and early warning of tourism emergencies. At present, although most of the video-based abnormal event detection methods work well in simple scenes, there are often problems such as low detection rate and high false positive rate in complex motion scenarios, and the detection of abnormal events can’t be processed in real time. To tackle these issues, we propose an abnormal event detection model in tourism video based on salient spatio-temporal features and sparse combination learning, which has good robustness and timeliness in complex motion scenarios and can be adapted to real-time anomaly detection in practical applications. Specifically, spatio-temporal gradient model is combined with foreground detection to extract 3D gradient features on the foreground target of video sequence as the salient spatio-temporal features, which can eliminate the interference of the background. Sparse combination learning algorithm is used to establish the abnormal event detection model, which can realize the real-time detection of abnormal events. In addition, we construct a new ScenicSpot dataset with 18 video clips (5964 frames) containing both normal and abnormal events. The experimental results on ScenicSpot dataset and two standard benchmark datasets show that our method can realize the automatic detection and recognition of tourists’ abnormal behavior, and has better performance compared with the classical methods.'}

First, our HRMF expands short text into long text, and then it simultaneously models multi-features (i.e., user, hashtag, text) of microblogs by designing a new topic model. To further alleviate the data sparsity problem, HRMF exploits hashtags of both similar users and similar microblogs as the candidate hashtags. In particular, to find similar users, HRMF combines the designed topic model with typical user-based collaborative filtering method.

For each subspace, we adopt Schatten \npp\n-norm to better approximate the low rank constraint. Moreover, Hypergraph Regularization is adopted to infer the complex relationship between genes and intrinsic geometrical structure of gene expression data in each subspace. Finally, the molecular pattern of tumor gene expression data sets is discovered according to the optimized cluster indicators. Experiments on both synthetic data and real tumor gene expression data sets prove the effectiveness of proposed DHLRS.'}

As a nonbank financial platform, online P2P lending tends to have both high volatility and liquidity. Therefore, it is of significant importance to discern the hidden market states of the listings (e.g., hot and cold), which open venues for enhancing business analytics and investment decision making. However, the problem of market state modeling remains pretty open due to many technical and domain challenges, such as the dynamic and sequential characteristics of listings. To that end, in this paper, we present a focused study on market state modeling and analysis for online P2P lending. Specifically, we first propose two enhanced sequential models by extending the Bayesian hidden Markov model (BHMM), namely listing-BHMM (L-BHMM) and listing and marketing-BHMM (LM-BHMM), for learning the latent semantics between listings' market states and lenders' bidding behaviors. Particularly, L-BHMM is a straightforward model that only considers the local observations of a listing itself, while LM-BHMM considers not only the listing information but also the global information of current market (e.g., the competitive and complementary relations among listings). Furthermore, we demonstrate several motivating applications enabled by our models, such as bidding prediction and herding detection. Finally, we construct extensive experiments on two real-world data sets and make some deep analysis on bidding behaviors, which clearly validate the effectiveness of our models in terms of different applications and also reveal some interesting business findings."}

However, due to the unique characteristics of the\nuser generated images in social image platforms, the previous studies failed to\ncapture the complex aspects that influence users' preferences in a unified\nframework. Moreover, most of these hybrid models relied on predefined weights\nin combining different kinds of information, which usually resulted in\nsub-optimal recommendation performance. To this end, in this paper, we develop\na hierarchical attention model for social contextual image recommendation. In\naddition to basic latent user interest modeling in the popular matrix\nfactorization based recommendation, we identify three key aspects (i.e., upload\nhistory, social influence, and owner admiration) that affect each user's latent\npreferences, where each aspect summarizes a contextual factor from the complex\nrelationships between users and images. After that, we design a hierarchical\nattention network that naturally mirrors the hierarchical relationship\n(elements in each aspects level, and the aspect level) of users' latent\ninterests with the identified key aspects. Specifically, by taking embeddings\nfrom state-of-the-art deep learning models that are tailored for each kind of\ndata, the hierarchical attention network could learn to attend differently to\nmore or less content.

In this paper, an adaptive fusion method based on a decentralized Kalman filter (DKF) and sensor confidence is presented for the fusion of multiple video sensors. The adaptive scheme is one of the approaches used for preventing the divergence problem of the filter when statistical values of the measurement noises of the system models are not available. By introducing the sensor confidence, we can adaptively adjust the measurement noise covariance matrix of the local DKFs and thus, determine the weight of each sensor more correctly in the fusion procedure. Also, the DKF applied here can make full use of redundant tracking data from multiple video sensors and give more accurate fusion results in an efficient manner.

This paper proposes a visual tracking algorithm that integrates the scale invariance of SURF feature with deep learning to enhance the tracking robustness when the size of the object to be tracked changes significantly. Particle filter is used for motion estimation. The confidence of each particle is computed via a deep neural network, and the result of particle filter is verified and corrected by mean shift because of its computational efficiency and insensitivity to external interference.

Nevertheless, traditional approaches either modeled these two kinds of behaviors in isolation or relied on a static assumption of a SNS. Thus, it is still unclear how do the roles of the dynamic social network structure and users' historical preferences affect the evolution of SNSs. Furthermore, can transforming the underlying social theories in the platform evolution modeling process benefit both behavior prediction tasks? In this paper, we incorporate the underlying social theories to explain and model the evolution of users' two kinds of behaviors in SNSs. Specifically, we present two kinds of representations for users' behaviors: a direct (latent) representation that presumes users' behaviors are represented directly (latently) by their historical behaviors. Under each representation, we associate each user's two kinds of behaviors with two vectors at each time. Then, for each representation, we propose the corresponding learning model to fuse the interplay between users' two kinds of behaviors. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed models for both user preference prediction and social link suggestion."}

Currently, most of image annotation algorithms are only annotating the object semantics of images. There are still many challenges on high-level semantic image annotation. The major issues are the lack of effective modeling method for the high-level semantics of images and the lack of efficient dynamic update mechanism for the training set. To address these issues, we propose a high-level semantic annotation method based on hot Internet topics in this paper. There are two independent sub tasks in our method: dynamic update of the training set based on hot Internet topics and search-based image annotation. In the first sub task, we propose to model the abstract semantics of images based on three relationships: image–to–image similarity relationship, topic–to–topic co-occurrence relationship, and image–to–topic relevance relationship. Through the complex graph clustering, the hot Internet topics are extracted for images with consistent visual and semantic contents. Then the dynamic update mechanism will update the original training set with the new topics and images. It avoids the huge computing cost in traditional update methods and does not need to re-calculate the whole mapping relationship between the semantic concepts and visual features. In the second sub task, given a query image, it first searches for similar candidates in the annotated training set via visual features. Then the hypergraph modeling and spectral clustering are exploited to filter out the images with irrelevant semantics. The keywords will be extracted for annotation from the remaining images according to an annotation probability. Extensive experiments have been conducted and the results demonstrate that our algorithm could achieve better annotation performance than the state-of-the-art algorithms. And the update mechanism could extend the training set efficiently so that the coverage of the semantics in the training set wouldn’t be obsolete.'}

To get velocity-varying model, it is considered for the first time, that longitudinal velocity as a state and output is decoupled with lateral velocity and yaw rate while the driving force is taken as the control input in the longitudinal subsystem. Based on this completed decoupling result, the subsystem with lateral velocity and yaw rate as states is transferred into a typical linear-parameter varying (LPV) system for the first time, where varying parameters are longitudinal velocity and its functions. Then to this LPV system, lateral velocity and yaw rate are decoupled into lower triangular structure with steering angles using a suitable distribution coefficient of total longitudinal force while the cornering stiffness coefficients are considered as uncertain parameters. To improve the robustness of the above decoupled system, a new LPV controller is designed at last. In this new control strategy, feedback signals are longitudinal velocity, the yaw rate and lateral velocity. However, lateral velocity need not be designed the observer or measured precisely. Simulation results show that, even though with a large velocity-varying range, the handling characteristics, safety and comfort of the vehicle driving are improved significantly.'}

However, existing trust systems developed for WSNs are incapable of satisfying these requirements because of their high overhead and low dependability. In this work, we proposed a lightweight and dependable trust system (LDTS) for WSNs, which employ clustering algorithms. First, a lightweight trust decision-making scheme is proposed based on the nodes' identities (roles) in the clustered WSNs, which is suitable for such WSNs because it facilitates energy-saving. Due to canceling feedback between cluster members (CMs) or between cluster heads (CHs), this approach can significantly improve system efficiency while reducing the effect of malicious nodes. More importantly, considering that CHs take on large amounts of data forwarding and communication tasks, a dependability-enhanced trust evaluating approach is defined for cooperations between CHs. This approach can effectively reduce networking consumption while malicious, selfish, and faulty CHs. Moreover, a self-adaptive weighted method is defined for trust aggregation at CH level. This approach surpasses the limitations of traditional weighting methods for trust factors, in which weights are assigned subjectively. Theory as well as simulation results shows that LDTS demands less memory and communication overhead compared with the current typical trust systems for WSNs."}

If the gain operator is designed in the form of a polynomial expression, a necessary and sufficient condition is obtained for the networked agents to accomplish the consensus tracking objective, regardless of the relative degree of the system model of agents. Moreover, the H\n∞\n analysis approach is introduced to help establish conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) such that the resulting processes of the presented learning algorithm can be guaranteed to monotonically converge in an iterative manner. The established LMI conditions can also enable the iterative learning processes to converge with an exponentially fast speed.

However, current CCN is still similar to traditional Client/Server network architecture, with limited cache space, and the request aggregation policy is suitable for live streaming media rather than streaming media on demand. The main reason is that user requests for streaming media on demand usually exist time difference, which may weaken the superiority of request aggregation policy and decrease the hit ratio of route cache, resulting that a large number of repeated requests are sent out by routing nodes. Some solutions focus on increasing the use ratio and hit ratio of route cache. However, those solutions exist some defects, such as with too high computational cost, not considering the real-time requirements of streaming service and the features of user requests. Aimed at the defects, we propose a peer-assisted streaming distribution mechanism over CCN, referred as PAS over CCN. In which, CCN user nodes are enhanced to support caching partial media resource, and new generated user requests are as far as possible forwarded to local CCN user nodes. Simulation results show that, PAS scheme can effectively reduce redundant network traffic, save bandwidth of egress routers, decrease the delay and hops for forwarding packets, and lighten the load of streaming media server.'}

However, limited by the current technology level and hardware cost, the capacity of TCAM is difficult to meet the needs for caching flow entries of large scale SDN, which would seriously affect the scalability of SDN. Aimed at the problem, some researches improve the efficiency of TCAM capacity by setting different lifecycle for different flow entries. Such as Openflow protocol proposed the default flow entry lifecycle, AHTM scheme dynamicly adjusted flow entry lifecycle according to the number of interrupted flows. However, these schemes didn't consider the dynamic features of network traffic in SDN, and hardly conform to the actual network demands. In order to effectively utilize TCAM capacity and thus enhance the scalability of SDN, we propose TF-IdleTimeout scheme to dynamically set flow entry lifecycle according to real-time network traffic in SDN-based data center network.

However, most of the existing network representation learning (NRL) methods are aimed at homogeneous or static networks, while the real-world networks are usually heterogeneous and tend to change dynamically over time, therefore providing an intelligent insight into the evolution of heterogeneous networks is more practical and significant. Based on this consideration, we focus on the dynamic representation learning problem for heterogeneous information networks, and propose a random walk based Dynamic Representation Learning method for Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN_DRL), which can learn the representation of network nodes at different timestamps. Specifically, we improve the first step of the existing random walk based NRL methods, which generally include two steps: constructing node sequences through random walk process, and then learning node representations by throwing the node sequences into a homogeneous or heterogeneous Skip-Gram model. In order to construct optimized node sequences for evolving heterogeneous networks, we propose a method for automatically extracting and extending meta-paths, and propose a new method for generating node sequences via dynamic random walk based on meta-path and timestamp information of networks. We also propose two strategies for adjusting the quantity and length of node sequences during each random walk process, which makes it more effective to construct the node sequences for heterogeneous information networks at a specific timestamp, thus improving the effect of dynamic representation learning. Extensive experimental results show that compared with the state-of-art algorithms, HIN_DRL achieves better results in Macro-F1, Micro-F1 and NMI for multi-label node classification, multi-class node classification and node clustering on several real-world network datasets. Furthermore, case studies of visualization and dynamic on Microsoft Academic dataset demonstrate that HIN_DRL can learn network representation dynamically and more effectively.'}

First, a weighted and directed heterogeneous academic network containing rich academic objects and relations is constructed. Then, an automatic meta-path searching method is proposed to extract the meta-paths for arbitrary prediction tasks. Two meta-path based object similarity measures combining temporal information and content relevance are also proposed to measure the features of the meta-paths. Finally, a pervasive link prediction model is built, which can be embodied based on an arbitrarily specified prediction task and the corresponding meta-path features. Extensive experiments for predicting various relation types with practical significance are conducted on a large-scale Microsoft Academic dataset.

However, the previous VNRs may overconsume the critical substrate resources and lead to the resource fragmentation problem in the substrate networks, thus reducing the acceptance ratio of the latter VNRs. To address this problem, we propose a novel collaborative VNE algorithm based on resource importance measures, RIM-ViNE, in which the global node importance and link importance in the initial substrate network are measured using multiple topological attributes and are used to set the embedding cost of VNRs. Then, the VNE problem is defined as a linear programming model and is solved by minimizing the total embedding cost, which could bring about the coordinative embedding between different VNRs, and thus preventing the critical resources from being over occupied by the previous VNRs with small requirements and improving the resource fragmentation problem. Moreover, we propose a dynamic reconfiguration mechanism based on critical nodes protection (CNP-Re) to improve the resource fragmentation problem further. Extensive experiments are conducted under two network scenarios, and the results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the VNE algorithms that only consider the coordination between node mapping and link mapping or only measure the node importance in the residual substrate network, and the average VNR acceptance ratio, average revenue, and average resource utilization ratio are effectively improved.'}

We define the concept of node-centric community and propose a multi-dimensional community detection algorithm referred as Hete_MESE. Specifically, we first specify one of the multiple entity types in heterogeneous information networks as community centric node type and extract the multiplex networks accordingly, and then, overlapping node-centric communities are detected based on the multiplex networks, which are considered as the seed communities to absorb the other entity types to generate the heterogeneous communities utilizing seed expansion. Taking heterogeneous academic network as an example, the effects of Hete_MESE are evaluated through extensive experiments, and the features of detected multi-dimensional academic communities are analyzed.

Recently, although the deep learning approaches have remarkably improved on single-camera data, these models still suffer from the seriously insufficient data problem, resulting in shallow model capacity and degradation in multi-camera settings. In this paper, to alleviate this problem, we present a Transfer Learning Color Constancy (TLCC) method that leverages cross-camera RAW data and massive unlabeled sRGB data to support training. Specifically, TLCC consists of the Statistic Estimation Scheme (SE-Scheme) and Color-Guided Adaption Branch (CGA-Branch). SE-Scheme builds a statistic perspective to map the camera-related illumination labels into camera-agnostic form and produce pseudo labels for sRGB data, which greatly expands data for joint training. Then, CGA-Branch further promotes efficient transfer learning from sRGB to RAW data by extracting color information to regularize the backbone's features adaptively. Experimental results show the TLCC has overcome the data limitation and model degradation, outperforming the state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmarks. Moreover, the experiments also prove the TLCC is capable of learning new scenes information from sRGB data to improve accuracy on the RAW images with similar scenes.\n\t\t\t\t"}

Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel security protection architecture for SDN. We design a security service orchestration center in the control plane of SDN. This center physically decouples from SDN controller, and thus constructs SDN security service to defense security threats. In particular, we set up a security meta-function base which can be used for security service composition in a rule engine. The rule engine can be realized by using the optimized rule composition algorithms. Finally, a series of experimental results show that the proposed security protection architecture for SDN can achieve effective security protection with small burden of controller.'}

However, with the increase in the complex and the number of rules, there is an increased risk of redundancy within the process of rule customization and execution. Obviously, redundancy will add weight to the system, affect the administrative operation, and reduce the system efficiency. To address the above-mentioned issues, a formal model Trigger-Actuator-Status for rules is devised. Such rules are defined as a tuple, which contains triggers, actuators, and states. Then, rules are processed with the methods of classification, combination, and analytics to generate redundant types so as to describe the redundancy relationship among rules. After that, a redundancy detection algorithm is proposed according to the determined relationship. Besides, in order to eliminate and avoid the occurrence of redundancy, redundancy for scenarios based on rule redundancy is detected and solved. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can provide more accurate classification results and identify part or full redundancy within and among rules. Meanwhile, our scheme enables redundancy elimination in the phase of rule setting and scenario setup as well as redundancy avoidance in the stage of rule execution and scenario start-up, which significantly reduces the number of rules to greatly enhance the efficiency of the systems.'}

In this paper, inspired by quantum computation, we present a new hash function by introducing alternate single-qubit coin operators into discrete-time quantum walk. The present hash function is classical with classical input and output. The compressive function can be implemented by performing alternate single-qubit coin operators on the coin state controlled by a classical input binary message and then applying the global conditional shift operator on the position state and the coin state. The classical output hash value is generated by making amplification, truncation, and modular operation on the final probability distribution. Numerical simulation and performance comparison show that the present hash function has an excellent property of collision resistance and easier implementation than existing quantum-walk-based hash functions.

The infrastructure providers (InP) can divide the physical network into multiple logical networks by NS, and the service provider (SP) can rent these NS instances from the InP to meet their own requirements. Since most multimedia services are usually QoS-aware, such as virtual reality (VR), mobile high-definition video and so on, caching resource can be allocated to different NS instances on demand to reduce the transmission delay and improving the quality of experience (QoE) of end-users. Due to the limited amount of caching resource, the issue about how to efficiently allocate caching resource to increase network revenues and save expenses becomes very critical for InPs. To achieve this goal, this paper proposes a delay-constrained caching resource allocation scheme based on Benders decomposition algorithm.

Software Defined Network (SDN) has received extensive attention as an important means of implementing network virtualization. In view of the problem of resource utilization efficiency and fault recovery capability in the network, and in order to meet the QoS requirements of different services, this paper proposes the network resource allocation and reliability guarantee mechanism of mobile core network. The Real-time resource-aware balanced allocation algorithm (RRBA) performs real-time monitoring on the utilization status of the substrate network resources, and preferentially allocates the services to the physical paths with more available resources, so as to achieve the balance of the network load as much as possible. In addition, in order to ensure the reliability of the network, a network mapping mechanism with backup is proposed. When the resource is allocated, the virtual network provides two network mapping results. In this way, when the original path fails, network traffic can be recovered faster. The simulation results show that on the basis of improving the efficiency of resource utilization, the reliability of the network is also guaranteed.KeywordsSDNMobile networkResource allocationNetwork reliability'}

In this paper, an availability-aware service chain orchestration (ASCO) mechanism including pre-pruned depth-first search (PDFS) algorithm and M-to-N backup mechanism is proposed. PDFS is developed from depth-first search algorithm by taking delay as pruning factor. An end-to-end reachable and cost-optimized path set is obtained and extended to final orchestration path through adopting of PDFS.

Once the controller breaks down, the switches will lose connections to the controller. This leads to severe consequences. In this regard, we propose an approach to improve fault tolerance of network in face of controller failures.

Cell Outage Detection (COD) which is the essential functionality in Self-Organizing Network (SON) is designed to autonomously deal with unexpected faults. Typical methods for detecting cell outage are usually based on Manual Drive Tests (MDT). However, it is difficult to detect small cell outage by MDT measurements in HetNets, because the User Equipment (UE) served by these small cells can switch to the macro cell and keep the Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) values normal. To resolve this issue, we propose a COD architecture based on the handover statistics. Our model concentrates on cell outage detection in a two-tier heterogeneous network. We process sequential handover statistics spatially and temporally in conjunction with data mining methods. Also, an improved LOF algorithm (M-LOF) is proposed to enhance the detection performance based on handover statistics.

If a link or a node fails, the switches that can detect the failure have to either inform controller to update flow tables or transform the data to pre-configured paths to recover the failure. However, existing failure recovery approaches mainly consider the recovery delay and packet loss, and ignore the storage resources consumption for backup paths in case of link or node failure. Moreover, the Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM) that stores flow entries is expensive and limited with high-energy consumption. Thus in order to minimize the consumption of backup resources and meet the required failure recovery delay, a backup-resource based failure recovery approach is proposed. Two metrics are proposed to grade physical links, and three kinds of strategies for different graded links are provided, based on which the approach tries to use less flow entries to recover link failure and meets the required failure recovery delay, while guaranteeing the reliability of the network. Simulations show that backup-resource based approach can use as less flow entries as possible to ensure the performance of failure recovery and satisfy the required delay of important traffic at the same time.

As regards to a security problem, attribute-based encryption (ABE) has been applied to the IoT system, but it still relies on the central server. Therefore, we design an ABE algorithm that could be used for multicenter scenario and shift DM to blockchain instead of a central server. Moreover, IoT devices always cannot afford complex encrypt computations as they have limited computing resource. To solve this, we design an obfuscating policy to shift encryption computations to the cloud instead of terminals. In this way, IoT devices could encrypt data with low computation cost.

Secondly, the scheduling strategy based on the maximum coverage of active pest periods with the minimum number of working SILs (MaxCAP-MinNWS) is proposed to address the turning \non\n and \noff\n scheduling of SILs, while considering the joint optimization of energy consumption and insecticidal efficiency. Simulation results show that compared with the existing preset working period scheduling and unified scheduling strategies, the proposed strategy can improve utilization of energy resources in insecticidal by up to 20%. In addition, the energy supply and consumption of SILs can be more balanced, and the battery deep discharging of SILs can be relieved.'}

When allocating resources to containers in edge nodes, end-to-end latency is an important performance indicator for evaluating strategies. However, it is often difficult to develop a delay model of the container cluster to obtain the real-time end-to-end delay of the service request flow. The state information is always extremely complicated in edge computing environment. Different container service combinations reach edge computing nodes at different time periods. The arrival rate of each container service flow also changes over time. In this paper, we first develop a dynamic M/D/1 queuing model to analyze the end-to-end delay of the data packets of the container service flow and use the average packet delay as the optimization goal of the Edge container resource allocation problem. Then a delay-sensitive resource allocation algorithm based on A3C (Asynchronous Advantage Actor–Critic) is proposed to solve this problem. Finally, we utilize the ESN (Echo state network) to improve the traditional A3C algorithm. Simulation shows that the ESN-based critic A3C(EC-A3C) algorithm has better performance by at least 10.9% than other algorithms in terms of latency and throughput and greatly improves the convergence speed of the network.'}

Therefore, as the data collection and transmission entity, sensing nodes should be classified and proved the trustworthiness. However, the existing works failed to classify and measure the credibility of sensing nodes multidimensional in real time. The previous trust-proof methods also cannot effectively protect the key information. To address these problems, this article first proposes a multidimensional and fine-grained dynamic measurement method in a trusted computing environment. Then, a trust classification model of sensing nodes is presented, and a grouping mechanism of different trust levels is designed to identify malicious nodes. Finally, a threshold ring signature-based trust certification scheme is proposed for data source authentication. It can adequately protect the privacy information of the attestation node and has complete anonymity and traceability.

Through collaborative content sharing, the storage limitation of a single edge server (ES) can be broken. However, when mobile users need to download the whole content through multiple regions, independently deciding the caching content for ESs in different regions may result in redundant caching. Furthermore, frequent switching of communication connection during user movement also causes retransmission delay. As a revolutionary approach in the artificial intelligence field, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has earned great success in solving high-dimensional and network resource management related problems. Therefore, we integrate collaborative caching and DRL to build an intelligent edge caching framework, so as to realize collaborative caching between cloud and ESs. In this caching framework, a fed-erated-machine-learning-based user behavior prediction model is first designed to characterize the content preference and movement trajectory of mobile users. Next, to achieve efficient resource aggregation of ESs, a user-behavior-aware dynamic collaborative caching domain (DCCD) construction and management mechanism is devised to divide ESs into clusters, select cluster heads, and set the re-clustering rules. Then a DRL-based content caching and delivery algorithm is presented to decide the caching content of ESs in a DCCD from a global perspective and plan the transmission path for users, which reduces redundant content and transmission delay. Especially when a user request cannot be satisfied by the current DCCD, a cross-domain content delivery strategy is presented to allow ESs in other DCCDs to provide and forward content to the user, avoiding the traffic pressure and delay caused by requesting services from cloud.

For complex, large-scale services, the services need to be migrated if the services are not completed before the vehicles leave the coverage of edge computing nodes. Trust and resource matching between areas thus become major problems. This paper studies the decision model of vehicular service offloading and migration. First, software-defined network (SDN) technology is introduced into the traditional network architecture, and a two-layer distributed SDN-controlled VEC network architecture is designed, which is divided into a domain control layer and an area control layer. In this framework, we use the consortium blockchain as a carrier to share network topology information between SDN controllers to prevent information leakage. We then established a service offloading and migration optimization problem model to minimize service execution delay, reduce energy consumption and maximize the throughput of the blockchain system. We describe the problem model as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm named asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) and design a dynamic service offloading and migration algorithm (DSOMA) based on A3C to solve the problem. Simulation results show that DSOMA can increase the throughput of the blockchain system, and DSOMA is superior to the deep Q-learning (DQN) algorithm and greedy offloading algorithm in reducing service execution delay and system energy consumption.'}
